"Indubitably, I am not worth anything as a being, contrary to the belief of all redditors who will reply to this, I have never once done anything correct in my life, all I have ever succeeded in has been to be hurtful and disrespectful to others and taking others for granted. 

All I breed is catastrophe. I am not at all talented or skilled at anything in particular, I am below average in every concept known to man. I have no motivation nor intention to progress in my life.

I seem to be an inconvenience, an unpleasant burden towards society. I'd say my existence is more so comparable to a tumor, I am not productive and only produce negative effects on others that unfortunately have the unbearable pain that comes from interaction with someone like me.

Entrapped in this body, I dream of going into eternal sleep, a great rest that lasts to the end of time. I do not have any interest in anything anymore, daily politics bore me a great deal and I'm not at all intrigued by life at all. 

I don't see a reason to not follow through with it when I have no intrinsic value and no drive nor intent to live at all.",1
"Almost everyday I wake up hating myself, why would I hate myself though? I graduated High School, have a loving and healthy family, have hobbies and online friends. Yet I find myself so paranoid and hateful of myself, why do I deserve this life I have?
Sometimes I just wanna scream, feeling like I’m trapped in another person’s skin, I feel like all my accomplishments are fake and I’m a useless slab of meat who’ll eventually die. I don’t have real life friends, post secondary, a job, a car or a license and the closest family I have is 6 hours away and barely talks to me. I want to be happy for the good things in my life but find hating myself all too easy. When I hate myself I feel selfish, like I’m so self-absorbed that I only care about myself. I just want to be happy like people online or in my family, to just always see the glass half full and not always half empty",0
To kill myself if im ugly?,1
"God help me.... I know I should go to the hospital.  I know I have to keep fighting....if only to prove to my children, cursed with these genetic tendencies of mine, that life is worth living.  I made my son promise at Christmas to get help, and he did and he is thriving.  My life long battle is starting to wear on this old soul of mine.  It feels like the same pattern over and over, no matter how many variables I change.  I am a very hard person to love.  My scars and cynicism are just a little too hard for anyone who tries to stay around too long.  Hubby has been in my atmosphere for 7 years...think it's finally getting through to him that I can not change the abuse I suffered, and the PTSD that resides in me and rears it's ugly head now and then.  My mother never wanted me and beat her belly before I was ever born....almost 50 years later and I still feel as unlovable.  I'm so tired.  My kids will be so pissed if I give up....my bf needs me right now....I can't abandon them all....Heaven help me.....I just want it to stop hurting all the time.",1
"I really don't want to do anything anymore. Whatever I do, I'll just feel like a failure. I always feel like a failure and a disappointment to anybody who is unlucky enough to know me. All I do is lay in bed now, go to school, then lay in bed at home. I keep wasting money on stupid shit to try and do something (miniature wargaming, d&amp;d, etc.) but I always just give up and go back to sulking. I fucking hate my life. This is the only place I can vent.",0
"I had a promising academic future. I had a wonderful, sweet partner. I had so much drive. I had so much support. People were proud of me. I have been a medical experiment for 2 years. None of the meds have helped much. I had to drop out of grad school after getting straight failing grades. The love of my life has fallen out of love with me. My grandmother, who raised me, died. I have thousands of dollars in medical debt associated with my mental illness and my only means of work is to take my clothes off and grind on strange men. I hate what my life has become. I hate what it is. I feel like I have nothing left to live for.",1
I’m within inches of losing my job. I (M25) spent the last year at this job spiraling in apathy and it’s catching up with me. I’ve been written up and reprimanded and if I lose this job I’m gonna lose my house and possibly my wife. Wtf do I do? My depression is just fucking my life up again.,0

One think i wont ever understand is my friends getting extremly sad when i mention that i want to kill myself. They always somehow manage to talk me out of it but i dont u derstand why they would. My life's shit and i dont look forward to amything anymore. I really just want to die. Thats literally the only thing that would make me happy. Shouldnt they want the best for me? Why do they always keep me from being happy? And why does it work?,0
"So I've been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now, and besides all the other upsides of therapy, I think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that I am incredibly self-aware. 

To the point that she usually just agrees with me and I spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself. Because I already know why my thoughts are irrational. I know I shouldn't let these things bother me. I know I'm not alone. I know this is an ongoing thing, I know, I know I know. 

And that's so frustrating. Because knowing doesnt make me feel any better. Knowing I need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone  doesnt help me actually get there. And when I get there, or think I've gotten there, I dont really feel any better. 

Yes, I'm lonely. I should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me. Great! Done that! Do this all the fucking time. But I feel the same. I'm still lonely. I still hate myself. 

Worst part is that I cant even blame anyone or anything. I did this. I'm doing this. I'm the problem. 

My therapist part of the problem is that I overthink and keep having these expectations for myself. That I should try to just ""do"" what feels right. But I already do that. If anything, I do it too much. That's why I'm starting to accumulate so much junk in my house. 

Idk. I just wanted to let the usual ramblings in my head out somewhere. I'm tired.",0
"If I could just, stop existing. I would do it in a heartbeat. But I can't... I have to commit suicide in order to do that. And even then I leave footsteps. My family would be hurt.

I just wish that i was never born in the first place. Then a poor family wouldn't have to worry about me. This is one of the reasons i haven't done it yet. My girlfriend would also be very upset. I just want to go without anyone being sad about me, like I never even happened.

That would be so nice",1

"i’ve struggled with depression for about 6-7 years (pre- high school. now i’m a sophomore in college). a lot of my sadness has come from relationships, being stuck in a shitty town, having friends but not having any GOOD friends, blah blah. i can confidently say i’m over my most recent breakup and i don’t really have any crushes on anyone, so that part of my depression has kinda weirdly disappeared? i don’t live at home so i finally have the freedom to go wherever and do whatever i want. i have the best friends i could ask for and some awesome roommates. my classes this semester are so low stress it’s kind of annoying and i’ve picked up new hobbies that are fun and make me feel good. 

but now i have a new problem. i’m happy. i think i’m like actually happy, or at least i’m content with how my life is going currently. but it feels wrong? i feel like i shouldn’t be happy and i feel guilty for feeling this way. i can’t remember one time in my life where i felt like this and it’s scary. like really scary. a very small part of me wants to go back and do something drastic to send me into another depression. but at the same time i’m like, no this is what you’ve been wanting your whole life don’t fuck it up now! just enjoy it! but it’s hard to enjoy because now i’m uncomfortable. this is all foreign and new and i don’t like it. sure, i was sad all the time before and could barely muster the energy to get out of bed and shower or eat, but as least i was comfortable. 

has anyone else ever felt like this? i feel kinda shitty for being uncomfortable and i just wanna know i’m not alone. i totally understand if i get 0 sympathy (like, who complains about being content with life?), but i really feel wrong. it’s like i lost a huge defining piece of myself and now i have no idea who i’m supposed to be or how i’m supposed to act without it.",0
I was just prescribed it for my severe depression and anxiety.,0
"Has some of you ever sometimes or all the times tell yourself that ""I hate myself"" like it just comes out out of nowhere? Or ""I want to die"".  Like I can be in deep thought and it just comes out without me thinking like it's a habit or something. I sometimes have to look around to make sure no one heard me. Does anyone ever experience this? Am I explaining this clearly enough?

"I want to die. Im not scared of death, or of what will happen, i have no one, my death wouldnt hurt anyone. But i dont want to hurt. I dont want to feel my lungs fill up with water and not be able to breathe, i dont want to feel cuts all over or a rope around my neck or anything else. It always will hurt. Thats what dying is. I dont want that. But i dont want this either. So im thinking of running away, from home, from society, from life. Maybe i could live in a remote cabin in the woods. Maybe if i had a garden and if i had to hunting, anything but this. I dont want to live this way. I know living on my own in the middle of no where is too much, its impossible to make sustainable, i couldnt get the money to even try, and even then, i cant get out of bed much less do everything. I feel hopeless, even my imagined fanatsy escapism i feel like theres no way out. Maybe suicide is the only option. Idk. I dont have any hope left, my hearts empty.",0
"(Read my previous post to this subreddit for context) 

***TW suicidal ideation***

I've got 318 days left until I turn 25... life hasn't gotten any better, a few things have potential to look up, but my depression and anxiety are definitely winning the battle. I fantasize about my own suicide daily. I daydream about different ways I might die/be killed. I intend to keep my promise to wait until I'm 25 even though I doubt she remembers the promise and we haven't even talked in forever, but man does life genuinely fucking suck. Honestly not much is going to pull me totally off this track at this point... so if I don't decide to vent on here again for a while, ttfn",0
"I reached my limit, nothing helps anymore, I tried everything I could get my hands on. My family doesn't even believe in depression. I'm just a big fat dumb loser, but it doesn't matter anymore, because tomorrow I'll put an end to all of this.

"I feel so worthless for so many years now.

but the past week I feel nothing else than  desperate, pain, sadness and emptiness. 

I've realized there is no one that would be there for me, never. 

I have vacations now for a month. After the first day I felt like nothing. I'm just something. Maybe a part of the nature. I mean I do nothing the entire day nothing at all because nothing helps. Everything is just boring and I don't feel anything. I have no one to rely on, every time when I start to make a friendship the people just leave me after spending too much time with me, I mean when they start to know me a little bit everyone left me. Or they use me. I'm getting sick of everything. 

People say things will get better, I'm happy that this is true for some people but it's not for everyone. I just feel like a shadow that no one ever notices. 

I changing my current state or emotions rapidly. Like the last time I played VRChat (a pc game for the VR, where you can wander around worlds meet other people and so on) I had fun but after one second it despaired and I was mad like hell for no reason. 

I feel like their are more minds inside my own mind. other kind of personalitys. 

I just want to end it all but I'm too weak to do it by myself, I see no exit out of this emptiness it got closed. I just hope everyday to die and to forget everything. Or to stop everything for a few years to take a break and get my shit together, but it's just too late. 

I don't even have a family that I could spend my time with, Not even a friend anymore, Not even anyone. Everything is just overwhelming and too much even there is nothing. I can't even cry.

This is just something to write down my stuff and idk. damn bro I never thought it would ever came to this point",0
"I really want to die. I just don't have it in me to go on any longer. Every single day is pain. And I have really lost my patience to go through it all. This world is just too much. I just can't make myself heard. No one listens. No one understands my fears, my pain. I am tired of begging the ones close to me to understand me. It more than often seems that I am just a burden that they are carrying, and until everything is right with me, they are right, when something goes wrong with me and I need their help, they take up arms against me. I am very tired of all this. I am tired of this life. I don't want to live any more. There is absolutely no joy in my life, just pretence. Every smile is a pretence, every laugh is a sham trying to hide the screams I am screaming inside. And it has been going on for years now. I am so tired. If I were numb, I could have lived through any pain for a long long time, but unfortunately I am sensitive as fuck. I don't know how not to get affected by my mind. I don't know how not to get affected by all the rubbish overthinking that I do. It is all my fault. All my fault. I am a crack. I don't fit here amidst all these perfection, who just can't take my imperfection. I am so tired Maa. Come take me. I want to go back to you. I have had enough with this world. It has been such a long time since the warmth of your void. There was no pain. Nothing to cry the whole night about. No night. No day. Nothing. I was just nothing like you Maa. Why did I have to come here? I couldn't have asked for a life like this, where my own mind becomes my enemy, and I sit like a mute observer, unable to change anything. Just watching and suffering every consequences on this body which won't even be with me when I leave. Why do I suffer so much? What have I done to deserve so much pain? Have I given someone this much pain in life? Maybe I have. And maybe it is all coming back to me. So I beg you, whoever you are that makes all things go.. give it all to me once. Give all of whatever pain you have kept for me, all at once. And release me from this shell. I do not want it any more. I have no use for such an existence. Take me back to the nothing that I always was. I want to die Maa. I've had it enough.",1
"I'm about done here, its time for me to punch out. No friends, no career and no passion for anything. I moved from Texas to my hometown in Wisconsin because it was the last place I actually remember being happy but I've been here for a year now and nothing has changed. It's been so long now that I've felt like an entirely useless waste of space. My family doesn't even care about me anymore but I still want to write something to my mom just so she hears it from me and not a phone call by the police. I just want to apologize for all the time and money wasted on me, I turned out to be such a disappointment and I just want to be gone. I'm saving up for a neat looking revolver so I can at least go out with a bang. I just don't know what to put in the text to my mom,I mean how can I just say that I give up, that the world wins, that they were right about me",1
"throwaway:)

As the title says, I am a very insecure person. I have grown up with parents who gave little affection to me and a narcissistic father who has crushed any self worth I have. Throughout middle and high school, I was popular but at the same time, I was never anyone's favorite person. I thought it was because I never had freedom or a phone during those times. I managed to escape and go to school away from my parents in college, but if anything, I have become even worse. I am so desperately afraid of losing the friends that I have made, in particular, someone who is the FIRST person in my life to have feelings for me. He knows me like the back of my hand, but now that we are doing long distance, it's naturally just harder and sometimes I come off as insecure when I ask him things. Most of the time, he is the only one I talk to about many things such as my parents which many don't understand. I just really don't want to lose him and he has said that he is tired of me being insecure, but I am naturally just not that special or pretty or smart and I can't help it. I wasn't like this when I met him, but I can't stop thinking about how he's going to find someone infinitely better when he starts his new job soon and never look at me again.

I am in college so I have little time for hobbies but I still read and work out in my free time. Most of the time I am studying, but I barely get by in school and can't land an internship for the summer.

Please give me some advice. I don't want to spiral",0
Does anyone feel like the only person that could understand your depression would be someone else that was depressed? But also feel like if they were to date someone who was depressed they couldn't handle it because it might suck you into a place that you don't want to be in again.,0
"This might sound ridiculous, but I want to die, and I'm not severely depressed. I'm approaching this purely philosophically.

The way I see it, my life is more suffering than joy, and that's probably not going to change. In fact, I would say this is true of most people. We spend most of our time doing things we don't want to do: working, cleaning, driving in traffic, feeling hungry, experiencing physical discomfort, etc, etc. Why would it not be better to not exist at all (I don't believe in an afterlife) rather than experience the totality of consciousness?

Now other people will mourn my death, this much is true. But they're going to mourn my death regardless of when it happens. No mourning is avoided by making it happen now. If anything, I'm at a point in my life when no one is dependent on me and my death will have the smallest impact it probably ever will.

So why not die?",1

"So after some deep soul searching the past couple of days i have come to the conclusion that i am still self harming (29/F) but not by cutting myself like i used to when i was very young. I seem to have created this character, or other personality i suppose? Where i just want to fight everyone, and I won’t back down, i’m not normally a fighter and every single time i hate myself for my behaviour the day after. I guess my thinking is that if i get myself into fights, i’m going to get hurt and a part of me is hoping to be seriously injured so i can just have a break from life 🙄

"I was going to a doctor who just wanted to prescribe medication, but none of it seemed to really help. And my previous doctor was the same. I tried with no luck to self refer to some mental health places but nothing panned out. I changed insurance recently and had to switch doctors. They referred me to a place which both me and my doctor were under the impression would handle medication and therapy.

So I scheduled a needs assessment and thought, ""finally."" But after the needs assessment they just wanted to refer me to more places. I tried calling most of them and they were either full with long wait lists, no longer existed(maybe wrong number provided) or no answer.

I called my doctor back and they sent a referral to another place, and told me I should get a call within the week. Its been 3 weeks now and no call.

Im starting to think finding treatment is hopeless. And jumping through hoops just to find a potential match is just draining.",0
"Hey guys,

so this is a throwaway account for reasons...

Anyways, I'm a freshman in high school and overall, I have pretty decent grades and I play violin (since preschool) and do sports. I have an extremely caring an overall amazing boyfriend, and an awesome friend who I basically consider as an older brother.

I have nothing to live for. My mother is verbally abusive, and when I call out for help with the few close friends I have left, she says I'm lying and she'll call me out and ruin my life. Now, I don't even know if I'm lying or not. If I am, just ignore this then. I really don't know anymore. Everyday, I'm so confused. I have no right to be proud of anything, and because I go to a really tough high school, often I don't have the time to practice violin (but I do a lot of competitions and honor orch, etc. so yeah not good) and yanno, college applications are coming up and I don't think I have anything to show. I do homework during class so I can finally relax during lunch, but I tell my mom I do homework during lunch to avoid getting my ass kicked. She compulsively checks my phone and reads my texts (more than I have my phone, her reason is that my parents bought it and not me), goes through my stuff and takes it, then tells me she did nothing of the sort, and yet I'm the crazy horrible reputation ruining liar here. I guess I don't even know if I am?

I'm just so tired of it all. I know that there's things to look forward to and live for, but I feel nothing for it. I've had suicidal thoughts and depression and whatever and my mom is saying I'm lying and making it up. I just don't know what to do, because even though I'm just a teenager, I could probably say my boyfriend is the only person I'd want to spend life with if things work out (I've dated before and so has he). But as of now, I'm giving everyone aneurysms or something dealing with me and getting mad at me. My violin and sports are doing basically nothing because I don't have time or energy and this generation is pretty damn good at this stuff. The only thing keeping me alive is the fact that I know my boyfriend probably would have a really hard time dealing with the fact that I was gone, for a very long time. I've been debating ending the relationship to make it easier on him.

I'm sorry, I don't know what to ask of y'all. Just please help me. I'm talked out. I just don't know anymore. Everytime someone tries to help everything honestly just gets worse. I don't have the energy or the will to eat, or function, tbh.",1
"It would be nice to hear from other people what you’re experiences have been like.

When I’m on my own or with people I’m comfortable around, I’m “normal.” My version of happy and normal anyway, whatever that looks like with depression wrapped in. 

Then, when I go out in social situations, I’m someone else. I’m frantic, I try too hard to be funny, etc. I’m socially anxious, I guess that’s the point.

But I find these opposites in writing too. When I’m writing I’m intelligent, I have a lot to say and offer people. But when I speak directly to people I clam up. I have a tiny vocabulary. I swear a lot. I saw the same words/phrases over and over. None of these things is particularly bad on their own but together it translates into me being a fucking mess. 

Do you ever find you’re two different people?",0
"To be honest, I'm 35 not much good has come of things. I studied hard and undertook an education degree at 25. It ended up making my mental health worse and I quit during my prac placement. I finished with a shitty Arts degree, but ended up with Honors...  It's not that I am unintelligent or incapable... In fact it shows some capability but no one is interested in what I do and I have no contacts so it makes it near impossible to get in to the job market.

I have panic disorder,  I am having panic attacks every day now (sometimes multiple times a day) which makes my life insufferable.  I have to use Xanax to maintain some what of a normal life... otherwise people think I am just lashing out at people (I'm not it's the condition). No one seems to understand anxiety, panic, and agitation. Doctors don't do shit, hospitals do even less. I've gone to hospital asking for help and am just put back out on the street.

I have been given Propranalol for anxiety. I have since told the  hospital I will swallow a whole bottle of Propanalol soon and no one cares if I do... It's the same result that I just get put back on the street even when I do ask for help.

I'm about to be made homeless and I can't support myself due to my chronic anxiety condition (panic disorder). My life sucks and there is no way to fix it.

I've suffered domestic violence and abuse in my family from the beginning until now and now I have finally had enough. I have been told to move out of the house I am living in. I have no reason to try or any interest in trying anymore.

If I will not die by Propanalol I'll simply buy barbiturates and do it once and for all properly. At this point the fear of going to prison for buying barbiturates does not bother me. I know how and where to get what I need to die... I have not got long left in this world.",1
"I hate being undesirable. I hate looking at myself in the mirror. Hopefully with this new haircut I could not look as untouchable. Especially since no one has liked me, I feel so pathetic in a way.

It’s late and all I think about these hours are either suicide or imagining I am someone else. When I can, I fantasize about how my day would be different if I was a new man. I would look better, have friends, a girlfriend, a full loving and able-bodied family, nice house, etc. I guess it’s just the land of dreams for me until I die.",0

"Hey can any of you all relate to this? I’m 22 year old male . My Parents divorced when I was 13. While they were married, my siblings and I witnessed verbal abuse, threats, dad pushed our mom, mom crying, dad coming home drunk, and even after the divorce they constantly talked bad about each other . Since the divorce, I became really sad and it follows me until this day. Some days I’m happy and then there are days where I cry myself to bed. The day they divorced, police had to come to the house because my dad was trying to hurt my mom. Soon after I witnessed my younger brother change from an innocent child to a drug addict. My father was an alcoholic who is now dead. My mother had the nerve to say to me “I don’t why your brother is like this... he didn’t have it that bad.” My mom really doesn’t know the trauma she caused me and my brother.

Just get rid of the noise and let me breathe again Why can’t I? I’ve already asked for help but no no it’s just me. It’s all my fault. It’s my fault for not making time for myself but no one seems to understand no matter how much I explain or how much I ask for help. I’m breaking down why doesn’t anyone understand that Doormat doormat even when I stand up for myself to try and not be a doormat the shit gets stomped even deeper into every fiber of my being it feels like agony agony agony. I regret everything I’m fucking miserable miserable miserable. I wish I never existed I wish I never made these ties life is awful, why would anyone ever do this to a sentient creature. Life is so fuckkng  horrible. It’s been so long now I’ve been living like this and it’s agony what a terrible mother I am can’t sacrifice enough, just wish I never existed and I never knew anyone and no one ever knew me",1
I winded up cutting. Broke my 65 days free from cutting. It felt so good to cut,1
I'm pretty sure I'm depressed but my parents don't believe in mental health and I'm too afraid to like go to a school counselor cuz my parents will ground me for just wanting attention or something. I wanna get better but I don't think I can without help of some sort. people say that meds suck and therapists suck and stuff but I feel like anything Is better than how I feel. I feel I need help but I don't know how to get it,0
"This is my own personal experiences not a how too or trying in any way to say my life is worse or the way I cope will help anyone else.

It has been a long journey, a fight every day, sometimes we win sometimes we loose.

Looking back 22 years ago, I was never formerly diagnosed with ADHD or Bipolar type 2 effective disorder, was never diagnosed officially as on the higher function autistic spectrum that all came much later.

The umbrella term seemed to be Reactive Depression relating to not only my Fathers death when I was 12 but my Girlfriend/Wife being diagnosed with incurable cancer at 21.

I spent the following 20 years fighting along side my Wife against this horrible illness that slowly destroyed her body until 20th November 2018 a double cardiac arrest with me standing next to her telling the doctors to stop because I knew she wasn't coming back. (her heart was a 14% functionality due to a silent heart attack 13 days beforehand caused by damage done via medication to keep the cancer away which also caused diabetes and kidney failure).

7 days after she died I was diagnosed with Bowel Cancer and spent that Christmas in hospital having 40% of my bowels removed (I have nodules on my lungs they are keeping an eye on).

Being in the same hospital as Paola died 6 weeks beforehand plus certain pain medication caused hallucinations and the beginning of my diagnosis of PTSD.

No family because my mum by this time was in a care home in late stages of early onset dementia.

It felt like the universe was just hitting me with punch after punch just to see how many times I could stand back up.

6 months on no one visiting so outside contact, I was on suicide watch and Samaritans help line actually called me weekly to see if I was still around, I had a plan to end my life, my logic boiling down to the following two points.

If I end my life and that is the end then I am in no more pain.

If I end my life and there is something after I am with Paola.

Had a plan, even down to writing a script that would send out emails to my Doctor and Psychologist so professionals found my body not my neighbors, my dogs had a forever home setup and I was visiting all the forums and communities saying goodbye to all the games me and Wife had played.

I was in a very dark place and the only light was an oncoming train which was either ""cancer comes back"" or ""A life without my best friend)

Everything was black and grey, nothing felt real to me and even when they told me 73% chance my bowel cancer wasn't coming back I couldn't smile and be happy.

**What changed ?**

One of the last places that I was going to visit was the game The Division, it had many good memories of us both exploring, shooting out windows, messing around, I did a walk through saying goodbye to my wife, and as I logged off an advertisement for The Division 2 came up and I thought to myself, ""lets see what mess they have made"" ""No reason to keep my money if I am going to end things"" So I bought the most expensive pack, downloaded it and logged on.

Something amazing happened, the next morning I wanted to log back on, I hadn't gamed since Paola had died, I hadn't interacted, talked or blown anything up.

A few days later I wrote a reddit post on that forum thanking the developers for saving my life.

The response was amazing and people started saying why don't you go on youtube, on twitch, why don't you talk about your experiences, mental health, cancer, diabetes, dialysis, heart disease, why don't you tell the world about how gaming helped you.

My response was ""what have I got to loose"", I watched my wife die, could anything anyone said about me making a fool of myself online ever come close to this.

I bought a mic, I bought a webcam, I did cooking videos, vlogs, streaming and those victories really helped me go from day to day.

I never missed a day at least 1 video every single day went up on youtube and twitch.

I have close to 500 followers on Youtube, close to 1000 on Twitch, others follow me on Facebook, Reddit and Mixer, I now multi stream to all 4 main places.

Am I still broken yes, I am classed as severely disabled, some days It takes me coming down stairs 3 times for me remembering to brush my teeth or do laundry.

I spend a lot of time in VR Beat Saber, SkyrimVr and others, Valve sent me a Valve index with no strings attached, after reading one of my posts (both me and Paola were involved in VR since 2016 due to her disabilities it was wonderful).

VR is an amazing tool for fighting depression, the complete immersion of being within a game be it a horror, a rhythm game (I have no rhythm), or fantasy, can help switch your mind to a world where life makes more sense.

My Senior Psychologist and 2 of my specialists have signed off on me all feeling that Gaming, VR and my Vlogging actually have given me a level of existence and a place to be.

I still suffer from depression but this is how I cope, I still need post it notes on my walls to remember changing clothes, washing and shaving.",0
"I've had SI since I was like 8 years old, and I'm 34 now. I've thought many times about what I would put in the note, who I would address it to. Would I write multiple messages, or only one? 

Tonight I actually opened up wordpad and started composing it. I'm just so tired. I'm so tired of feeling like every day is a fight just to exist. I'm so tired of fighting self-destructive impulses and not winning, I'm so tired of feeling guilty because I'm using up the Earth's resources. 

I *know* my husband would be a happier person if I'd just grabbed some balls and taken care of this years ago. He could find someone who actually contributes to his happiness instead of having to support me through my never-ending nonsense. I stood in the way of his chance to establish a new relationship a few years ago. I should have just packed my things and gotten out of his way, but I was selfish. I'm so fucking selfish. If I really loved him I would have let him go to find happiness, instead of expressing my own emotions and selfishness and guilting him into staying with me.

I'm aware that I'm not adequately considering his agency in this evaluation, but I'm also aware of his background. Religious guilt, familial obligation, he's the one who wanted to get married, etc will all contribute to his feeling of responsibility. 

I've almost posted here so many times, but I've always talked myself out of it in the past. I'm not calling a hotline and taking up resources from someone who might actually benefit from them.

I'm also too chickenshit to actually do anything about it. I'm terrified to wind up locked up again (have done a stint in a psych ward at 18 and being strip searched is not something I'd ever wish on ANYONE). I just know I'd fuck it up somehow and not actually complete killing myself, and then I'd be stuck even more miserable.

I don't want to die, I just want to have never existed.",1
"I'm supposed to kill myself on my 20th birthday. On some days, the only reason that I even function is the thought of me killing myself in the near future. I really can't wait for it. My whole life is starting to fall apart slowly and slowly. My whole body feels so tired and just wants to rest.",1
"I didn't get into med school. My boyfriend is mad and ""disappointed"" in me because I won't tell my parents. He thinks my family can do something because I have connections to a school. I don't want my family to contact the school because if I didn't get in I don't deserve to get in. I'm just a disappointment to everyone. I don't deserve anything. If I'm not smart enough to get into grad school I don't want to live anymore anyways. If I'm not smart I'm not worthy of living.",1
"Our relationship was the best up until the 19th of February. I let my insecurities, fears and depression get me and I overwhelmed him. I drove him away and now it feels like we dont know each other. all our conversations are one sided. I haven't seen him for weeks except for the two times I asked to talk to him. I'm in a worse state and the only way I can win him back is to get stronger but I cant. every day I come home, lay on my bed, stare at the wall, cry and remember this all my fault. He's a good person and he doesn't deserve someone ruining his happiness. today I'm preparing myself to let him go. I love him with all my heart but I cant stand it anymore. I want to get stronger but I just cant. All my friends dont know about it because I dont want to overwhelm them like how I did with him. Again, I felt alone. And I hated it. Why couldnt I be happy like 2 months ago? Why did this sadness come back? This is much stronger than what I felt for the past 11 years. Buy when the day comes where we part. I dont think I'll ever truly be myself. I made myself worse. And I just let it happen.  I keep making myself worse. I hate myself for that. I really want it to work out, but maybe it's too late for that. the damage is done.",0
"A bit of background:
I’m 25, F and live in eastern Canada. I live in a small town where more people here fake being ill to get out of work or have other habits.

I’ve been suffering from depression for as long as I can remember being alive. I was first fully aware that I wanted to die since I was 6, I’ve begged for it every day of my life since then and every birthday, that’s what I wished for; even til this very day. 



I’ve been going to a doctor in my town to continue working on my depression, she prescribed me medication which started to make my state worse by an increased amount of suicidal thoughts, more flashbacks, and now irritation as well as mood swings. I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, Dysthymia and Anxiety. I’m constantly trying to make it a point to address to every doctor I’ve been to in the past 8 years that I literally hate being alive and I’ve even been honest as to how many times in a span of a year Ive tried to commit suicide, even up to date. I’ve tried signing myself into our local hospital to try to be admitted to get real help and they’ve only ever kept me for a night each time. Ive begged to stay and I’m still sent home since I seem calm. 

I have always acted like I was fine in front of people since I was raised that it was not okay to be depressed or show negative emotions as I had an abusive mother. Because of that, I can’t express sadness normally, instead I just seem calm and most thing I’m being sarcastic or trying to be funny. I don’t openly cry in front of others since I honestly hate people seeing me cry when I’m a support figure for a lot of people I know. 


I’ve tried making appointments with psychiatrists (we don’t have psychologists at our hospital, they’re hours away and I can’t drive), but they often push Ativan which doesn’t react well with me. I’ve spoken to therapists and they have said I’m getting help in that way but I also need to be medicated if therapy isn’t doing much for me. 

Does anyone know what I should do?
I can’t keep fighting this anymore. I’ve been doing all that I can and I feel like it’ll never get better when all I do is hide in a bathroom and cry each night, wish that I was dead if there’s no fix for what’s going on or just isolate myself from others so I won’t be a burden anymore.",0
I’ve reached a new point in hating myself I constantly feel as if I’m worthless and not good enough. I think about the days where I could just wake up and be happy and how I’ll never feel that again my life’s been hell for 3 years. I am not good enough for any girls because my body is disgusting and I can’t speak to them to save my life. I truly have no worth so little that my dad doesn’t even love me. I’ll be graduating hs in a few months and I’m scared because I know I’ll fuck up my whole life with my shitty decision making why the fuck did I have to be alive,0
"Life was really great but then things just completely changed and now life is just really horrible. I find myself thinking about suicide more often, and I thought about it before during a bad time, but now I’m just more sure that I’m gonna do it and I’m kind of relieved about it. I can imagine myself about to die, and I’m not as fearful as before. Anyways, I’m thinking of making a plan soon, and I’m thinking about hanging or maybe even using hydrogen sulfide (detergent suicide). If anyone knows anything about using hydrogen sulfide and any discomfort associated with it, I’d appreciate learning about it :)

I’m so exhausted guys, I just wish I had someone to talk to but I feel like I just get this weird feeling that stops me from talking about it to a specific person. I hope I can end things peacefully. Thanks for reading.",1
"Let me start of by saying I'm not diagnosed, I haven't really experienced any traumatic incidents in my life and I have no intention of harming myself.

However, due to events in recent months, I feel so empty, like I don't give a fuck about doing anything. Even feeding myself has become something I try to avoid. I don't take care of my appearance, I do the minimal work I need to get by and I rarely socialize with the few friends I have.

These are part in part to a belief that has formed in my head: life is meaningless. What is the point of doing anything? We slave away through school, to get a place at university, then we slave away through uni to get a good degree, then we slave away in a job we will probably hate to make sure we don't end up on the streets. All this, all this pointless cycle and in the grand scheme if things, it makes no difference.

I think a lot of times to myself, if I were to disappear now, would anything be affected? Have I had any impact at all on the world? Will I even be remembered? The answers are always no. This has produced an emptiness inside me.

The emptiness leads to a lack of people, activities and more, which in turn leave me feeling lonely and unfulfilled respectively. Yet I again feel a lack of desire to do anything. I don't know what this is or why I think like this, but I would appreciate it if anyone could give me some sort of method or exercise to break this cycle.",0
A terminal disease looks like it's my only escape. Going to focus on getting terminal cancer or maybe sudden death due to heart problems. Wish me luck. I'm serious. I'm done with life.,1
"I'm 24 years old. I've consisrently failed at pursuing all my dreams. A year or so ago I broke up with my ex girlfriend. I met her 2-3 years ago, memory is getting foggy, I'm sure y'all understand. Before that I was lied to, cheated on by the few other girls I'd been with. She dropped into my life out of nowhere. I met her online and at first we were both apprehensive... I didn't want to get hurt more but she was there for me. She helped me see therapists for my disorders, she helped me get out of bed and go to work every morning. We lived in different timezones and she would stay up through the night to wake me up in the morning to hear my voice. I fell in love with her. She said she loved me too. I flew her to where I lived and she took two weeks off her work which she takes seriously. She maintained she loved me, things were even better than she had hoped. After she left everything started slowly crumbling. I was getting worse without her and she couldn't deal. She couldn't deal being away from me, according to her, and I could see my disorders were bringing her down, even when I was on antidepressants. She eventually broke up with me. And it's been a year, and I'm living with someone else. She's living with someone else too. I don't feel anything anymore guys... I just try to not cry every day. I'm not fucking happy. I miss her and we text occasionally, she knows what she wants, and it's not me. I've lost interest in even sex now, worse than with the SSRIs. I really don't know how to keep going. I tried moving on, I tried changing homes, I tried pursuing passions but everything just falls short. I feel like I'm just pretending I care about things in hope that I eventually will and this torture will end. I just hope I don't have to live this fucking broken.",0
"So life is okay pretty good I guess wish we made more money but I’m happy. Or I’m not. Doesn’t matter I still feel the very VERY strong need to kill myself and it lasts for a while like a week or for a short term like a few hours. Sometimes I feel like I have to slit my wrists in a tub or put that bullet in my brain or swerve into a truck but I know better. It’s something in my brain that is triggering this. I am a Christian a real one and I ask God at times to take this from me and it helps but it’s like a voice a little guy on my shoulder waiting and watching and anything can trigger it. UHG! So frustrating. I think about how my dog, my husband, my brother sister and nieces and nephews need me but the voice doesn’t care. I was just wondering if there is a part in the brain that does this? I have never done hard core drugs but my mother was high on speed when she was pregnant with me... and she has a dopamine issue because of all the drugs and falls into deep depressions or gets suicidal from it. Maybe it’s hereditary or maybe because of the drugs she did when pregnant caused the issue with my brain? Anyway any thoughts would be helpful thank you in advance.",1
"I can’t put it into words all the time but depression to me feels like I go through life with this tight tight pressure just squeezing on my heart all day long and I just have to ignore it and go throughout my day with nobody knowing what’s going on. But when I snap and I cry it’s because the pressure has just built up too much and I just can’t handle it anymore but I only snap in private because once you cry and once those emotions are out of your system and you have momentary relief you think, well that was silly and it’s not that deep I’m fine. And then this cycle of pressure builds up all over again and you just have to pretend like nothings wrong but you’re truly not ok. 
I can’t explain this to the people in my life cause I’ve always thought maybe I’m just making up my depression because I can go throughout my day. I’m not bed bound. But if I reflect on my life, I’ve always tried to cope in some way. I used to binge eat so much and I notice I have the urge to do it whenever I’m feeling especially down. Then it was movies &amp; tv shows I would drown myself in for hours and hours. Then it was music to drown out my own thoughts. It was reading endlessly at some point but I’ve lost all interest in all of those things and I find being awake to be so draining so now all I do is go to my classes and go to sleep. I hate being awake. I hate feeling this pressure in my chest and it sucks because I was free from it for a few months and it’s back and you just try and tell yourself you’re just having a bad day but you know it’s some sort of relapse. It’s hard because I don’t want to take medication, I don’t know if that’s going to make things worse for me and I don’t want to be numb I just don’t want to feel pain. On top of that there’s so much fucking stigma. I can’t talk to my parents about it cause whenever I do they get angry I feel sad because I’m their eyes they’ve given me the perfect life despite all the abuse when I was a child. I can’t talk to my friends cause they’re all optimists with the “it gets better” attitude and it pisses me off cause all I want is to get held and just cry. I always feel like I’m being punished for something and I don’t know what cause I try so hard to be there for others. Whenever I can’t find love and I see ordinary people super happy in relationships I question what’s wrong with me (I’m not saying I’m super attractive but I have assets that would at least attract people). when I start questioning why I can’t find a good relationship or someone who likes me it loops back into my thought of well how do I expect that to happen if my own father walked out on me as a child. Everything just fucking sucks and I can’t even focus enough to do my uni and It.just.sucks.",0
"Hey, this is really weird for me and I wouldn’t normally do something like this but I don’t really know what else to do. Ever since I was a little kid I have thought life was pretty pointless and I kinda just wanted to die. As I grew up it gradually got worse and at this point I seriously just want to kill myself. I don’t have a bad life or anything I have just been searching for so long and I’ve never found a reason to want to be here. I have always had a problem making friends, I am always there for people and I love being able to help people, people just don’t like me. It could be a perception thing tho. In any case, I just spent two years with someone who I believe to be one of the most amazing people in the world, I loved him so much and genuinely thought I would spend the rest of my life with him but he broke up with me. He told me he was never happy with me and it broke me. I have met millions of people and I don’t believe I will ever be happy with someone like I was with him. I can’t be happy without him and he can’t be happy with me but to be his friend and see him happy with someone else would tear me to pieces. Everyone says I’ll move on and be happy again but it’s been months and it still feels fresh as the day it happened. The only reason I am still here is because of my mom. She guilt trips me into not committing suicide even though she has also always been suicidal. She also doesn’t believe in therapy and thinks making your bed will make the depression go away. The idea of killing my self isn’t scary to me and I know the people in my life will be sad but I am not enough of anything to anyone for it to be a big deal. Idk why I’m posting this, guess I’m just wondering what other people think about it.",1
"The other day I realised that how I felt wasn’t just my pain it was my mother’s too. 

I haven’t felt suicidal for about a year now, in fact after recent medical problems all I’ve wanted to do is live a normal life. I have always been a sad person, naturally and I suppose this can take a toll on the people around you but it was only the other night that I saw just how much it could. 

Every night my mother stands outside my door and says “Goodnight love you sweet pea” to which I ALWAYS reply. Except this night I had a headache so I forgot about staying up later than my parents so I could check all the doors were locked. Instead at around 9 I went to sleep. About half an hour and a half later when my mum was going to bed I woke to see her standing at my door. I was half asleep so I said “I’m trying to sleep” and she apologised and went to bed

The next morning I questioned her on why she stood at my door and she said “Every night I say goodnight and it’s not just to remind you it’s for me to check you’re still alive but last night you didn’t respond and I went to go to bed but I stopped went back an said goodnight through the door again and you didn’t answer so I opened the door and thought oh she’s asleep but then as I walked a way a voice in my head said you were dead so I stood at your door waiting to see you breathe. 

The point is even though I moved on and that I haven’t felt depressed for over a year my mother still does every single day. No mother should have to worry like that. It’s not selfish and I’m not saying that I’m just saying that it’s not okay.",1

"Disappointed
That's the one word I would use to sum up the way I feel. Disappointed in everything. 

Myself, for being...mediocre. That's the only word that comes to mind when I consider my life. I've been given so many gifts and people that love me, and I waste it all. I don't quite understand what's wrong with me, but I know there's something not clicking right in my brain. People talk about a certain fire behind someone's eyes, a drive that pushes them to work hard for their goals. I dont have that. I'm not passionate about anything. I find myself with no motivation to do anything, even doing days without eating. Some days I'll be how I used to, full of energy and making people laugh, but, as quickly as it appeared, it's gone. I'm back to laying in bed all day, not speaking to anyone, not doing anything that I'm not required to. The only thing that impresses me anymore is how easily I lie to my own family. As soon as they call, I become this other person. The person they want me to be, who does well in school and never had any issues. 

I don't feel joy anymore. Not a trace of genuine happiness, other than the aforementioned 'good days'. Even the things that used to make me happiest, like Christmas, now just seem annoying and pointless. I can't sleep, often laying awake for hours on end. 

Fuck, I miss him. I miss my Da. I would give anything in the world for 5 more minutes with him. He was everything to me, my whole world. I loved him with everything in me. You could come to him in the worst possible situation, and he would tell you what you needed to hear, and you would always come away feeling better. But now he's gone. He left, leaving a mess that my family has yet to fix, and now I'll never see him again. Never hug him, or hear his roaring laughter. I'll never again have him look me in the eyes and say ""I'm proud of you, son."" And that breaks my heart. Sometimes I go back and listen to old voicemails, just to hear his voice. 

I'm disappointed in my family, some more than others. We all came together as a family for the funeral, and not even 24 hours later they're already fighting. I don't understand what I have to do to let them know I need help. I shouldn't be too hard on them, but if my friend who hasn't seen me in 3 years can discern I'm struggling over the phone, surely my own family could tell. I told them I wasn't ready to go back, that I couldn't handle it, but they didn't listen. I've never once in my life had real freedom. Freedom to choose what I want. Thats not exactly true. Theres 2 options: do what they want, or be on my own. 

Disappointed in those around me. Now, I could never blame anyone here for my problems, but damn if they can't tell. There are people here who's job it is to identify people who are struggling. They haven't approached me, nor have any of my 'friends' here. I went to the counselor once, and after an hour of talking, he told me that he thought my Das death might have had an impact on me. No shit. Say what you will about my high school, but I'm more comfortable telling anyone there that I'm struggling than I ever would be here. 

I don't know where something went wrong, where I lost my drive, but I want to fix it. I want to be happy again, but every day that seems farther away. Every day, I feel less like myself and I just want it to end.",0

I had one shot at a decent job and I didn't get it. There's nowhere else near me where I can apply. But my boyfriend got a job at the same place.

I'm volatile and emotional. I hurt everyone around me. I've driven everyone away. I have literally, and I mean literally, no one. I don't know why I'm like this. All I do is make other's lives hell.

Fuck I want to die. I want to die as painfully as I can. I want to be flayed, burned, and disemboweled. It's what I deserve in life. I've caused so much pain for everyone around me. I fucking hate myself beyond words. I can't think of anyone I hate more than myself. I just want to die. I want to die so, so badly. But I can't do it.",1
"I used to bottle things up. Hope they would just pass without causing any problems... they usually would and because of that I thought it would be a good way to deal with stress and all of that. I was wrong. Ever since I tried being more and meeting more people and making my life more exciting it just hasn’t worked. If anything it made things worse. Stuff just keeps getting added to my bottle and now the cap doesn’t even fit on the top. It’s affecting the people I’m around and I don’t like it but I also don’t want to tell them what is wrong because I don’t want them to worry or be concerned. My feelings are leaking and I don’t like it because they are noticing. I feel like I’m doing more harm to them by not telling them. I just want everyone to be ok but I don’t want them to know...suicide has been a very present thought in my head but I don’t want to leave...it would just hurt them more..hopefully my thoughts on that won’t change or else I won’t be here for long...

"Feel free to downvote me into oblivion or to just move on. 

I just can’t do it myself. I want to die. In fact, I can’t actually envision a future for myself. The way some people see themselves getting married, having a career they love, having children, etc., I just don’t see that for myself. Instead, I only see myself dead. Sadly, I don’t have the strength or fortitude to end my own life. I have a plan for ending it all, but I just don’t think I could actually follow through with it. 

I have a fear of commitment, and committing to that decision is something I just can’t do. Several times everyday, I daydream about someone walking up to me and killing me. If someone else did it for me, it would make things so much better. Ironically, this makes me want to self harm, but self harming itself has left me with scars that make me feel worse about myself which, in turn, makes me want to end my life or self harm more. Despite what a lot of people say (or will say), I just don’t think there is a reason for me to continue living.",1

"I (edit : 20f college student ) hate it the feeling of waking up everyday with the same two thoughts "" I wish I never woke up. Oh well another day that I can't wait till it's over"" I feel empty emotionless and sad I have been feeling like this for years(4 years). I thought about ending it millions of times. It's still tempting to this day. I wish I would have someone to talk to but I don't want to burden anyone with my feelings. I hate myself and everything around me and these days it's been getting worse and worse. More emotionless and more empty. I want to cry but I literally can't find tears. The problem is I don't even know what's wrong with me or what's bothering me or how to fix it. I feel so alone. I am an introvert with hard times expressing what my feelings are. And whenever someone notices something is wrong I have the tendancy to avoid them / put alot more distance. This is my second week of only sleeping 3 hours a day... I am still wondering how am I even standing up. I can't remember the last time I was happy or laughing from my heart. I know that everything will be okay but what if okay comes too late...

"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. 

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

"I have been dealing with depression since my mid-teens. It comes in waves. I go from a deep depression to a more mild feeling, but it’s always there. As I got older, the low tide began to stick around longer than the high tide. I have tried numerous prescriptions with no result, and no other form of therapy has caused the slightest change in the way I feel.

For the past year, I have lost all enjoyment in every aspect of my life. Usually this passes but this is the longest stretch I’ve had. It’s almost like I’ve come to some sort of acceptance that this is how I’m going to feel forever if I don’t end it.

The current climate of the world (I don’t mean Global Warming) has also pushed me the closest I’ve ever been to ending it. I used to enjoy movies, music, television and video games as a form of escape. I can’t enjoy them anymore. The hyper-politicalization of EVERYTHING has corroded away the enjoyment I received from the few things I used as an escape.

I am very good at hiding my feelings, and nobody knows about my thoughts and plans for suicide. My friends and coworkers all know me as an easy going, relaxed guy. I also don’t want them to know, so it’s a full time job on top of my job to keep it up, and it’s exhausting.

I made plans on how I would do it during my last low point, and I’m closer now than ever. I have all the means to pull it off, I just have to do it.

**TL:DR**
I have done a lot of reading when I procrastinate from work. I want to start a daily journal on reddit to keep track of my positives and negatives, my progress, and hopefully get advices on when I go wrong. 
I noticed that I get overtly stressed over tiny chores/work/things to do, and I'd like to tackle it via progressive increase in exposure and desensitization. Then incorporate other CBT techniques.

***Story/Background:***

I have only recently been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder after a close friend forced me to. Looking back now, I think I first had mild depression around 16yo.
I recall having a general apathy towards life, results, ambition, family, and friends. Any motivation is fleeting and I'd spend most of my days daydreaming. Perhaps hoping for some catastrophe in the school so that I'm no longer bored.
The depression seemingly subsided - at least I think so - as I continued on aimlessly on some path my family/culture/friends expected of me. while I'm not excelling, I'm not underperforming. I have close group of friends and we enjoy movies and outings.
It all went to hell when I was around 22/23yo. I should add that I have Contamination OCD and during my University days, decided against my better judgement that I should live with a close friend.
This proved horrible as my OCD meant I couldn't live normally or telerate their habits. I thought I had it in control and hid my oddities well. I didn't. 

My housemates at the time hated me and talked loads behind my back. All the while I was oblivious about their hatred towards me while they acted normal around me. I noticed somewhere around 3 months in. I had the chance to look through their messages and curiousity started my depression.
Reading through all those hate filled complaints and messages was painful. Having to sleep in the same room as him after was impossivle. To act civil while I moved out was tough. While we did not have a big fight because we both hated confrontation,
our 6year friendship fell apart; along with it, I resolutely cut ties with the entire group of friends that was associated with this guy. 

I believe this to be the ""event"" which kickstarted my depression. Worse still, I moved to a different place and had another falling out with another group of housemates. We started off great, even went on a trip together. In about two months, I don't recall the cause of it. But I remember they confronted me on something and I just started withdrawing from them. 
After that, I stopped going to lectures and classes. I was fired from my club because I couldn't perform anymore. (I spent the first year making it into the committee), As a result, I graduated with a subpar GPA. I've never felt worse. I feel like I disaappointed my dad, wasted his money, and failed to prove myself to those who looked down on me.
I spent the next two years isolating myself in my room, only going out for groceries if I absolutely have to. I avoided the housemates by being active at odd hours. I lied to my family that I was trying and failing to apply for jobs while the truth is I mindlessly watched seasons after seasons of brainless TV. 
I am eternally thankful that my dad supported me through this lie. He paid for my rent, food, and courses I took because I wanted to extend my visa. Oh, I was also an international student so you can imagine how much money that costed. 
I cannot begin to describe the amount of guilt I feel. 

The reason I'm even trying to get better is because of guilt. My main motivation is to make them proud of me.

When I was 27, I spent a year dodging their concerned calls. They were so worried they sent a friend over to check on me. And finally, they took a flight over themselves. My visa finally expired and I went home.
After getting home, I once again lied to them about job searching and spent a year doing my best to avoid family events and outings. Finally, last year they forcefully got me a job with my relatives and I've feel into a routine since then.
I majored in Finance and Accounting in Uni. But my results were subpar and it has been 3-4years at this point. I barely remember a thing and I can't perform. I can't even get myself to pick the knowledge back up. 
Admittedly though, the work I perform doesn't require that much. But alas, I fail to perform. I find it difficult to get myself to issue a simple invoice which takes 5muinutes tops. 

I am more and more disappointed in myself over time. I hate the job, but I haven't even sent out a single resume. The very thought of going for interviews and exposing myself as incompetent frightens me. GEtting judged by anonymous HR people makes me hate myself.
I contemplated all kinds of alternatives ie: getting a remote part time job so that I can make extra income while improving myself. Taking courses online and hopefully put me ahead of others.
Ultimately though, I have not brought myself to do any of those things. Even this reddit post took 5days of contemplating before I could do it.

I know what I should do, and people will say ""you never know if you never try"" but I can't help but imagine the negatives. Posting for help on reddit for example opens me up to judgement from random strangers, trolls, even scams, some of them incredibly damaging. 
Improving myself via courses/books/lectures can be an enormous time sink. Not to mention that what is learned may not even be useful to me in the future and may end up being a waste of time.
Currently, I spend the measly 4 hours of free time I get after getting back from work watching movies or reading novels. They're not entertaining nor boring, but they keep me sane. I dread the day that they are taken away. 


***Analysis:***

Growing up, I've been instilled with the idea that I am smart, but lazy. I believe this became a part of my core identify. I'm 29 and I don't recall ever working hard, for anything. 
I've coasted through life however, largely because my parents made me go to numerous additional tuitions, cram classes, etc. I've never done homework, mostly copied them off of friends, but have the concept repeated to you enough times and it gets carved into memory.
My results up till 15yo were always above average. 

I believe due to the circumstances, I grew up without developing any self-discipline skills. Never having an aim or goal and simply going through the motions meant I was lost the moment those guidance were taken away. Believing myself to be smart also creates a subconcious anxiety - what if I worked hard but still failed? that would mean I'm not smart.

Throughout life, I have had a panic attack twice. Once when I was 10. An art project which took me 20minutes tops was criticised and I broke down in tears and hyperventilated, having to be taken home from school.
The next was when I was 16. Around this time, I was getting progessively more apathetic at school. I struggled to get up in the morning and was often late to school. I was late for 10 times and my parents were called to school which resulted in me hyperventilating once again.
I also spent a lot of time gaming which I believe was some sort of coping mechanism similar to mindlessly watching youtube or browsing reddit. 

Not entirely sure what these events mean. But I think I can conclude that I have an inability to accept criticism or face consequences of my own actions. 

***What I want to do:***

As stated above, I want to tackle my self-disclipline, responsibility avoidance, and anxiety towards work, via progressively increasing exposure. 
I will practice mindful relaxation and attempt to associate the relaxation with the trigger(work).
I will also journal on reddit. 1. To have accountability, 2. to further dissect my thoughts, analyze the issues, solve them. and 3. to get advice.

"Hi so I would like to know what's your opinion on this.

So there was an activity at my college, in which students from different schools were coming the univ to see it and explore it. When they came, the college gave them a ticket to get a free meal. We, students of the college itself, are really unhappy with the university because they always have money for anything but the university itself, charging us a lot of money for things that are not there. So we, unleashed, decided to take back what's ours. One guy printed out a lot (maybe like 15-20) tickets of the food and we went there to get the food by ourselves. So at the end of the day, the food was done earlier than usual. We did it only for 2 days out of the 3 days the whole college stuff was happening.  We didnt do it the last day cause they realized something was wrong and printed out a different ticket. So we didnt go, also because they were being suspicious and asking questions. 

Do you think we are getting punished?it was only like 25 juice boxes and sandwiches, that's it, out of the probably 200 or 300 there were there.

"She was yelling at me about school stuff in the car. I usually stay calm and let her get it out of her system but today I snapped and told her that I’m suicidal, hoping that she’d calm down. She did not. She belittled me for it while I tried to keep myself from crying too much. I tried again, telling her that I want to kill myself and asking if that’s what she wants. Her immediate response was “You know what? Do what you fucking want.” 

I’m so tired. I’m sixteen, this isn’t normal. I defend her at every turn, even now in group chats with friends calling her abusive while I’m sleeping over at a friend’s house because the thought of returning home makes me feel like I’m gonna puke. 
I had a vivid image of my dead body covered in blood with a note saying that line of hers and a smiley face. I also want to see the look on her face when I walk up to her with a knife in my hand and tear my wrists open. I want to damage her as much as she’s damaged me. 

I’m not as depressed as I normally am, surprisingly. Just tired. She came by with a bag of extra clothes for me and I think she found an empty pack of cigarettes in my closet because she took a shirt of mine that was under it (I hide it between layers). My friend went out to get it for me because thinking about talking to her face to face made me anxious. She blamed him, to his face, for me wanting to switch schools; that he scared me out of my current program. 

I’m not actually going to kill myself or anything, as much as I want to. It’s too short notice for me to make any final preparations. But I think if I hadn’t called my friend I’d have broken my self harm clean streak and cut down to the dermis again or maybe even deeper. 

The icing on the cake for all this is that I got called selfish by my mom for not coming home. Her boyfriend’s mother passed away recently (we live with him) and her funeral is tomorrow. I have selfish timing apparently, and I’m not even the one who started this whole thing in the first place. I’ve cried so much that I don’t feel any strong emotions anymore. All I have right now is sadness, but it almost fades into me being tired. 

I also have guilt. Not because of this but because I have an important group project due tomorrow and I was supposed to make a poster. I obviously wasn’t able to complete it. People’s grades are going to suffer because I’m too weak to just walk inside the appartment and sit through some yelling     

I just don’t deserve to live, I guess. I’m a massive letdown to everyone in one way or another. People would be much happier with me gone, my parents are divorced and though my dad would be upset about losing me at least he won’t have to put up with my melodrama anymore. My mom won’t have to stress herself out over me being too tired to put effort into school, there wouldn’t be any strain on her relationship with her boyfriend anymore because of me. My classmates won’t have to worry about bad grades because of a flakey group member. My boyfriend can get someone who won’t ruin his mood all the time just by talking about their feelings. My family doesn’t have to worry about me being a disgrace or anything, if a member dies by suicide they’ll likely just get pity rather than dirty looks after I inevitably become a junkie. 

The only one I would really feel bad for is my dog. I don’t see him often, every few months or so. But he loves me about as much as I love him. I don’t know how I could ever explain to him, in a way that he’ll understand, why I’m leaving and not coming back. Why it’s not his fault, the extent of how much I love him, how good of a boy he is. That’s just something I’ll never be able to do for him. 

Vent over. I need to get some sleep but I don’t think I’ll be able to get up in the morning. 

If it’s any consolation, to those that have read this far, I’m seeing my psychologist tomorrow.",1
"My best friend is literally the sweetest person ever she brought me so much chocolate and facemasks to make me happy, even if its just for a few seconds and I just can't stop crying about that.
I really, really, really want to die, I even cut myself to prepare me mentally for it and if she would have known that I'm doing that right now, she knocked on my door and gave me that. 
I really don't know what to do anymore. I don't want her to be sad because of my death but on the other hand I just can't stand this life anymore. Please help me. She is literally the only reason I am still alive.",1

I posted a cry for help on the confessions subreddit and all the comments and nice things that people said delayed what I thought was the inevitable but then a friend say the post and came and talked me down and I really wish I would have jumped I constantly think about going back to that building climbing up all those stairs getting up on that ledge and jumping and it's getting to the point were I dont think I will be able to stop myself from going there again the instant I can.,1
Things seemed to look up. I followed the light. It was an illusion.,1
"I did something stupid. 

I only talk to one person about my mental health. She is the only person who has ever helped me not be depressed. After being depressed and okay-ish at my best for about a decade, talking to her made me feel happy. And it wasn't just for a minute, an hour, or a day. I felt happy for about half a year. 

That was what led me to tell her. I wanted to thank her, and I couldn't say thank you without telling her why. When I told her about my mental health, she was supportive. Even though I haven't felt happy in about five months, I still look forward to talking to her.

But today I did something stupid. I started an argument over something that so trivial that one noticed it. Usually when I am speaking to anyone, I try to think about what I say before I say it, because I would hate to say anything that bothers people, but not today. Today, I when I was with her, I didn't once stop to think about what I was saying. If it came to mind, I said it. 

I didn't think she was bothered until she told tried to tell me something like ""I spend my whole life making sure I don't... Isn't it ironic that that I end up doing that?"" As she said that, I saw her face get red and ber eyes start to tear up a little. And I realized that I was being a fucking asshole. 

She has never asked me to do anything. Not a single time. She has helped me when I am having suicidal thought. She has helped me when I feel like I am about to have a mental breakdown. She has helped me through a lot. And I just go and return the favor by being the worst person to her.

I have been trying to distance myself from her, because in the past couple of months, life just hasn't felt like its for me. I don't think that I should ever feel better. Depression is exactly what I deserve. Everytime I have caught myself feeling a little better, I just tell myself what I have to feel like shit again. Now, I will find it easier to no longer talk to her. As much as I looked forward to talking to her, I look forward to her forgetting me.

There isn't a whole lot keeping me from having the thought that makes me take my last, she is one of the two things that even just thinking of her helps me keep the suicidal thoughts just thoughts. I think she still wants to talk, and I know I will see her for at least the next 2 months, but when those 2 months are up. I won't talk to her, and I will do everything that I can to keep me from ever talking to her again. I don't want to make her sad or ever make her cry again.

Right now, I know I probably won't gather up the courage to end it, because I still have to see her. But I did resently take up self harm. I started by hitting my upper thigh, so no one would see the marks. Recently, I started growing out my hair, so that no one will notice that I started hitting my head. A while after I see her for my last time, the odds that I'll finally do it will rise.

I fucking hate that I possibly made someone feel anywhere near how if feel most of the time. I hate myself even more for doing it to the only person I have ever felt safe enough to tell everything about anything.",0
"Burial By the Sea

I want the waves to sing me their lullaby 

I want my last sight to be blue

I want to wait five more minutes and see if dolphins guide me somewhere new

It'll be near the cliff side

It'll be near the shore

It'll be so that the sand covers my body to be seen nevermore

Perhaps inside of a tent

To disguise the sight from the tourists' naked eyes

Perhaps outside of the caves

To refrain from having my spirit be alone in the dark

Maybe I'll see stars

Maybe I'll see the moon 

But most likely it'll be when the sun sets after noon 

I think it'll be peaceful 

Not so much for those who find me

But I won't know

Because I'll be home",1
"Actually I like living but not with this situations. I'm 17 now, today is my birthday. I have mental ilnesses for my childood, when I was 11 my ocd starts. And I have  depression for several years. Sometimes it's go up and sometimes down. In 7th grade I sleep all day. And this year I'm actually be aware of my depression. And I have paranoia too, ever since last year. I took antidepressant and antipsychotics. And this time I take 2 capsule prozac every moening. And also I'm going to psychiatrist. First time I've go to psychiatrist is nearly 3 years ago. And I'm going to psychologyst too in last 3 years (not continuonus). But I can't be happy. Always I'm thinking something. I can't be relax. I can't be peaceful.

"I am use to depression causing me to eat tons of food. I self medicate that way, even with meds and therapy- food is usually the only thing that can distract me. 

Now, however, food is bland and gross. I get no satisfaction from it at all and now just eat once a day because *science* says it gives me energy.

Now I feel unsatisfied. It was the last thing I still enjoyed. I can’t read, I can’t write, my musical instruments (cello, piano, guitar) are literally gathering dust. I stopped playing video games that require thought, I haven’t sung in half a year. I hav n’t drawn since before Christmas.




Is this life now?",0
Im literally not good at anything... I have no skills whatsoever. Im 19 and I still live off my parents money. I have no job. I don't go to school. Everytime I try to better myself I give up halfway.  Im the biggest disappointment ever. I just fucking hate it. I wish I were just dead already.,0
"The summer of 2019 I started developing severe OCD after suffering from mild, unnoticeable OCD for many years. I just feel so tired of things, so bored of living, but I can't commit suicide.

I know that there are people who care about about me, like my parents, and the shit they would have to go trough if I commited suicide is unbearable for me to imagine.

But I just wished I didn't exist, that I never was born. I wish I could vanish from this world, be gone like the wind.

I often wish I would die in an accident or disease, because maybe that would be less painful for the people around me then if I would commit suicide.

I have stayed home from school for about 2 months because of illness related to the stress, not stress from school, but from my mental health. I feel crippled.

One day I woke up and was completely emotionally numb. I couldn't feel happiness, sadness, anger or any other emotion, but it got better. But I really wished it wouldn't have gotten better, it was ""amazing"", I couldn't either feel anxiety so all I felt was blank.

When I think about the meaning of life I always come to the conclusion that I want to marry a wonderful woman, have kids and grow old and die of old age, and this is the other thing keeping me alive.

That was my story.",1
"I'm posting here because its anonymous and frankly I just wanted to speak my piece before I end it. I feel awful inside, everyday trying to mask the pain with busy work, or arrogance and charm towsrds others to distract myself. I've felt empty for quite some time. I finally opened up to my wife about these thoughts a year ago and she blamed me for how that made her feel knowing I want to kill myself. She left me some short time after. Since then I've had about 6 months of time to really digest my thoughts and feeling. I feel an incredible depression each day and then feel even worse when I think about my children having to deal with my death. For a long time that deterred me from suicide, now it seems more like a valid solution to my pain and a way for everyone to move on. I dont want anyone to find my body which clearly describes suicide. On the contrary I'd like to frame my death so the narrative suggests a noble death and therefore easier on my family. Of course my children love me, but it's been an incredibly long time since I've felt love or purpose. I feel like a paycheck, a slave to everyone else's needs, a pawn in someone else's game. I'm happy that I experienced love, excitement, danger, success but I feel now at the age of 35 the good days of ignorant bliss are behind me. Anyway, just figured I'd put this out here, to people that wouldn't tell me how selfish I am, or how this doesnt help anyone. I just want the pain to end.",1
"I’m very depressed. I’m also an antinatalist. And I’m also a nihilist. 

So, I do not think there is a point to living. Furthermore, I wish I was never born.

"For a few months it's been overwhelming. I've lost multiple friends in the last two months alone due to how I act. I dont think I'm exactly wrong, but I only kept about 2 to 3 friends and now they just wont contact me. I feel insignificant contacting them because I've only gotten a response once or twice. I'm falling out of my work schedule, every night thinking of how I would end myself until i realize I'm thinking about it. The past six months have been so hard on me, and I'm only 20. I know i have many years more to live but it feels so hopeless as i think that I'm gonna die one day, why keep feeling like this forever? I feel like I have no hold over my life, I cant stay in one place for long, much less keep a steady job. In the moment I just say fuck it and quit and move on to another, I dropped out and am an alcoholic. I cant clean because it feels hopeless as well, everything just piles up until I'm at this point, and this time i dont know if i can move on. My dreams are repetitive and of the same person, and i cant shake that no matter what i try. Right now just seems like the time to save my family the pain of doing it later and just ending it. I dont know what to do. I want to make an impact on the world but know the chances are oh so slim, and it seems a lot easier to die.",1

"I know I'm not gonna kill myself, but that doesn't distract me from the fact that I want to. Over these past few weeks, my suicidal thoughts from last year had resurged.. I feel like an absolute failure; an absolute burden to those around me. Every day, whenever I hear someone laugh, I instantly feel as if they're making fun of me. I feel like nobody really likes me... as if all my relationships are fake with others. When people make fun of me, I just let it happen. I either laugh along or smile like a fucking idiot because I don't want to cause any more problems for the person. I feel as if each time I say something, I ruin someone's day. Just today, I said something I shouldn't have... and now I feel like absolute shit even though I apologized after realizing how shitty it was for me to ask that. I don't think he accepted my apology anyways. My grades aren't bad by any means, I have B's and A's in hard classes, but I feel like I'm just crunching under the pressure. My parents hate my grades and all my friends around me seem to just be doing much better than me. I really just think I'm a failure and will never do good in life. I feel like people hate me and view me as a burden. Each time I try something, I never turn out to be good at it. I feel as if I'm bad, or simply average, at whatever I do. I'm not creative, musical or smart. Do I really deserve existing if I can't make a single difference in this world?

I go to a psychiatrist and I am on meds but nothing seems to be working. (Ive changed almost 7 therapists/psychiatrists now because my mental health was showing no improvement.) I feel like a parasite, latching on to my mother and aunts for financial support. I want to move out and live independently but I don't even feel anything. I don't feel like doing anything, let alone wanting to work. I constantly worry whether I'm just being lazy and making excuses or whether I genuinely have a problem. I don't want to face people, give interviews or work among other people. Everytime I get a job I end up having panic attacks and excessively stressing out. The thought of having responsibility and knowing that there are certain expectations I have to meet while working, and the constant anxiety of doing badly at my job trouble me so much.

"I would like to share my situation here presumming this has already been talked about a thousand times. First of all, forgive my English as it is not my first language (Im from Spain).

Im a 26 yo civil engineering, graduated in 2018 after 5 long years of hard study. Before this, I did a couple internships in civil engineering during college. The second one went pretty good and my boss actually wanted to hire me but I decided to leave to start the masters. After finishing it one year later and not finding any job, I ended up in an energy company, in the sales department, a field totally different than my educational background, where I stayed temporarily until I could find something in my field. The thing is, several months have passed and Im still here but also I found out I dont like this job, to the point that it has driven to a state of depression and unhappiness, but still here because of the money. The situation has been aggravated since I cant find anything else, resulting in a feel of no motivation to find other jobs and challenge myself to reach higher in life. Also, I feel that Im not as competent as I should be and that makes me feel bad too. Times is passing and Im still stuck in this conundrum with the pressure of no succeeding. I know this relies in the survival of the fittest and work hard concept but it seems to be more difficult for me. The only times I feel an extra shoot of happiness is when I practice sports or Im with my girlfriend/friends. But then this bleak mental state hits back again.

Wonder if any of you have experienced a similar situation and how have you dealt with it.

Thanks in advance! :))",0
"So I’ve been depressed since about 4. Started cutting around 12, the same time I had my first flashback to the first time I was raped. I made serval attempts since I was 16, never really trying hard enough. But tonight I really really really wanted to do it. I tried cutting myself but the knife I got wasn’t sharp enough... my boyfriend ended up calling me in the middle of everything. So I talked to him about it, I was on hold with the suicide hotline anyways.

I guess I didn’t REALLY want to otherwise it would’ve worked? I’ve always heard of people just cutting, but it ends up going too deep and that’s how they almost die. Don’t know why I’m writing this.. actually I do I want to hear from someone. Encouragement, your story, anything.

"&gt; **[Trigger Warning: self-harm descriptions]** I found this in my notes in my phone from 4 years ago. I forgot how much I used to write about what it was like living inside my mind back when I was at my lowest point.

**Chemical Imbalance**  

It always starts with something taken out of proportion. A misread text, a misunderstood gesture, a misjudged opinion, or a misguided tone.  
“I love you.” They attempt to bring you back to a reasoning reality.  
But love isn't *love* anymore.  
Love is fake.  
Love is wrong.  
Love is *hate*.  
*I hate you*. Their mimicked voice echoes.   
Triggering the avalanche of spiteful words spraying from your pale lips.   
*They hate you*. The voice darkens.  
You watch them slowly fall into your torturous whirlwind of abuse. You watch them cry for help and ask for you to stop and listen to yourself, listening to you hate yourself and want to die is too much for them.  
Then you watch them leave. You watch them run away in fear.   

Your bony fingers crack as they clench into a fist. Your jagged nails are digging into your skin.   
Anger engulfs your vision, taking control of rationality.  
The first blow strikes hard on your face. It stings, but you go a second time. And a third. Until your head starts ringing.   
*You seriously fucked up this time*. The dark voice echoes.  
You can't see anything for what it really is.  
“But you said they hated me!” You argue with the little self-worth you have left.   
*Yes, and you believed me. You stupid little girl*.  
That restless feeling of guilt starts trickling down your spine. Did you jump to conclusions? Did you just impulsively hurt a loved one’s feelings? Did you just make them witness something so traumatic it will never leave them?  
*Yes, you're a twisted abuser*.  

No, you can't be here. You can't be alive anymore. You don't deserve it. You have hurt someone who needs you, you have acted out of spite.  
*Do it. You're worthless. They don't want or need you here*.  
More impulsive actions unfold, you only want to escape the guilt and anger that overfills your head. But you're scared to do it. You're scared to make the final exit by your hand.   
*Cowardice. You can't live and you can't die. You are pathetic*.  

The razor is in view. Tears are finally pushing out, causing more pain than the blade that now pierces your skin. Scarred and thin, the skin breaks. But no satisfaction is found unless you cut too deep. Only disappointment seeps in, blaming yourself for your cowardly slashes. Not going deep enough, pathetic little scratches. Why can't you feel more pain? Why can't you cut deeper?   
*You fail at even the simplest things*.  
You cut more. Faster, harder. You want centimetres, not millimetres.  
But still the same depth, still the same shit.  

There’re too many cuts now. But still no pain, only numbness from the raw wounds you view.   
But the blood won't stop. Your wrists are painted. Like stained crimson cloaks wrapped around each arm.   
You slip in the dark puddle and feel the red wetness of the towel you clench.    
“Take me!” You scream.   
“Please just take me!” You keep screaming at the otherworldly force.   
Pleading for the way out, pleading your heart would just stop.   
Now a mess of tears and blood on the floor, you weep.   
The sounds of silence bounces in your head.  
The dark voice is gone.   
Nothing.  

A door opens.   
The realisation of someone witnessing the mess you are in kicks you up.   
You can smell the shame from your cold sweat. You can see the damage you've caused yourself and the one who is about the enter.  

“I'm sorry.” You whisper.   
You are numb and frozen as they wrap the bandages around your wrists.   
“I'm sorry.”   
You can see the pain in their eyes. You can feel the fear in their trembles. You can hear the confusion in their silence.  

*You don't deserve this love*. The dark voice echoes.   
And then you fall back into the abyss.",0
"My mom is my biggest supporter but also the most sensitive and emotional person there is. When I want her to cheer me up, she starts crying too because she’s so empathetic and it ends up being me who has to cheer HER up. She doesn’t mean to, it just happens. I love her to death but her emotions often comes first. Which makes me not wanna talk to her about my health at all.

I turned 16 yesterday, but I feel like my life is going by way too fast. I’m gay, have no friends and all I do is lie in bed and cry. 

Because I’m gay, I’ll never experience the feeling of having a teenage romance. I’ll never get asked to prom. I’ll never glance at a guy in my class and get a smile or a glance back. I’d say I’m fairly handsome to my knowledge and I try to care for others so it’s not that I’m undateable. It’s just that “everybody’s straight until proven gay”, if you know what I mean.

I just wanna live in a world where I can ask for a guys number without him being weirded out because “he’s not a homo”.

My life is going by way too fast. I’m afraid I’ll be alone forever. I’m impatient. I know I’m only 16. But I’m already so tired of this life. I’m missing out on so much the other straight kids my age are doing. I wanna live their simple life, but obviously I can’t. 

I’m just so tired of everything. I want it to end. I want to believe that I’ll be reborn as a straight guy or girl. To fall in love and having a chance with them. I want to live that life. I want to live an easy life with the only struggle being that the screen on my phone has a crack. I don’t believe in it, I just wish that’s what happens when you die.

But I can’t take my life. I could never do that to my mom. As I said: she’s emotional. She would be heartbroken. She’s been depressed before and I’m certain she would grow into old habits if I were to disappear. 

Sometimes I just wish she would die so I could take my life without hurting her. It’s awful and I’m ashamed to be writing this. I just want everything to end. I want everything to end with my mom.

EDIT: Hey, it’s me a few hours later. I almost become a different person when I have these kind of depressive episodes. Looking back at this post now, I feel bad. I now understand that what I said can come across as ignorant. Which I certainly am. I’m only 16. I have a whole life in front of me. And when I’m feeling this down, I push all positive things about my life away. I have to hold on. I have to wait. My life has barely begun.

I don’t actually want my mom to die. I just wanted to disappear without leaving her behind. I’m feeling better now but I’m sure I’ll come back to this post when I’m sad again. Sorry for being dramatic and all over the place. But thank you all for taking your time to read and reply to this. It helps more than you think.",1
"I had a depressive episode so I moved back home, and have had depression for years but never confided in anyone. 

My parents are great and caring, and my mom is even a nurse, like 80% of the time they’re great.

But sometimes my mom can bug me.. like in the waiting room at the clinic while waiting to get recommended for a psychiatrist for depression she says: You still have it right?

Like what?! She has a nursing degree and asked that. I mean she’s usually very supportive but just this small thing makes me very confused. I am doing much better now that I have a routine and am not alone and suicidal everyday but just because you don’t see my depression doesn’t mean My depression went away.

I’ve hid it for at least 6 years and i was very good at it. I’m an actor. But it irks me that she would say that.

I’m 19 and sorta tall sometimes when we’re out shopping or something she talks about things that I’d rather not discuss in the middle of the mall, like “oh, yeah we should discuss when you should attend classes,” and we never discuss this at home.

It feels like she’s justifying my presence, like this is why I’m here with my 19 year old son on a Monday shopping and he’s not in school. Honestly it’s embarrassing and even if Im overthinking it I feel anxiety in public and I really don’t like standing out.

I’m pretty sure my depressions from her side of the family as she and her grandmother have had antidepressants. Don’t get me wrong we’re close and I love her, but sometimes it’s very annoying and any constructive criticism I give the way she responds is never in a way that doesn’t make me feel guilty about pointing something out.

Whenever there’s a problem she seems to blow it out of proportion, and I’ve stopped trying to help because if we go down a wrong street I become implicated in the problem and she makes it feel as if the world is ending even though everything works out. 

Sometimes it feels like she lets things go wrong on purpose, I can’t even count the times we have gone out for something and she forgot her bags, or we forgot to bring some package for the post office, or something similar. Whenever this happens she says “oh I should have thought of that” “I’m so stupid” “I should have known” and it makes me feel as if she is expecting me to remind her of these things. I appreciate all the things she does but if it’s something she organizes for example shopping like I have no control over what she forgets to bring but she somehow makes me feel responsible, or at least I do somehow. 

I just can’t understand this negative side to her and it seems like somethings always wrong and if it is she exacerbates it, I can’t tell if it’s from her depression if she has low self esteem and is hard on herself if she makes mistakes or makes mistakes on purpose, regardless it affects me.

I know not everything here was directly about depression but I thought because it relates to my situation might as well say what’s on my mind.
Does anyone else have perspective on having depressions and living with parents? Im lucky to have supportive parents but sometimes I’m not sure how to deal.",0
"Do yall ever feel so numb and empty, but at the same time you feel so much pain and emotions ? And its so confusing but what are you gonna do about it ?  
Just last week I was feeling better, and now I'm back at the bottom

I don't understand. I have an amazing boyfriend and friends, my family is shitty but I know they do love me, I've just suffered from so much emotional trauma from them.

And I do feel happy sometimes. When I'm with my friends and boyfriend all we do is talk and laugh, but when I'm alone I feel so hopeless. Which makes me wonder if I'm actually even depressed.

It hurts, everything hurts so much.  
I just found out my, ""best friend"" who I've known for 6 years, doesn't want to be my friend anymore. Because I've been so busy with school, and I've been so stressed and just exhausted I haven't seen her in a few weeks and then I found out today from her brother.

My family is a wreck, my mom is always telling me about all her problems and I have to listen and counsel her, I'm just a teenager mom,  I wish you would take me to that doctors appointment like you promised you would so maybe I could actually get some help, instead of running off and leaving for days to God knows where.

I haven't been to church in weeks, church has always been so important to me, but lately I don't want to go, I don't want to see the people there that I've known since I was a baby. I don't want to do anything in my free time but lay on my bed.

I want to cry, I want to cry so badly but I can't. I physically cannot cry, and so I'm just here, shaking, in pain, and at the same time feeling nothing. I'm so scared, I don't want to do this anymore, I can't do it anymore I just want it all to go away. I want to go to sleep and never wake up. I wish I could be telling my friends these things, but I'm supposed to be the friend who has every thing together and helps everyone else.

I'm sorry, I needed to rant.",0
"I don’t know why but, ever since the breakup with my ex 2 months ago, I’ve been feeling more alone, more suicidal. I was by no means not suicidal before the relationship or during the relationship but now I’m out of it, I feel cold, alone and suicidal a lot more. Something about being held and comforted by someone who I actually loved was peaceful. I’m a very heavy guy (16 stone heavy) so I’ve always found Bad luck in relationships. Due to this and the countless bullying I suffered due to my weight, I’ve been very depressed and suicidal, and when a person comes into my life, I just get attached to them easily. I just feel like I’m worthless, like I don’t deserve the happiness I want to have. In times like this I just want someone to lay down with me, cuddle with me, and reassure me they won’t leave me and won’t hurt me. I fucking hate the way I am, I want to think normally, I want to be normal, but I can’t fit in anywhere.",1
Nothing aint fun nomore nothing excites me nomore nothing to look foward to nomore life aint fun nomore so whats the point of staying?,1
"Maybe this will be the last time I'll be posting here, and allow me to express my gratitude for all of you, I have met few amazing people through here in the last year and I'm glad, that I spent the last year without the rules of the society and at my will, well worst and I don't regret a second of it. I'm glad to have had such a privileged life, ups and downs but most of it all was such a ride. I'm content, I'm not angry or upset nor feeling helpless, I'm feeling like it's time. It was a good 21 year ride, and bless the reddit for it helped me laugh countless times with the memes and helped me get in touch with myself through its amazing redditors, you all rock, hope to meet you all one day after that rainbow bridge. 
Thank you and goodbye. :)

Update: I was caught by my mom while preparing for it and she didn't need a second to release what I was about to do, I'm on surveillance now, there goes me, failed again. Nonetheless, thank you to everyone who tried to reach me and left a kind comment. Back to hell, back to reality, back to existing.",1
"I give up.  I have been over life since I was a teenager and I'm not doing a good enough job hiding it anymore.  My boss even pulled me aside with concerns. 


""When I was interviewing you you had the best interview I'd ever seen. Where is that guy? You miss work, you're emotional, you have lost all your passion"" 

My mother can't even talk to me without me going into tears over being the worst son ever. She hasn't said anything to that effect but does notes that I'm not eating. Not doing anything anymore. When I'm off work I end up spending hours just staring at the walls and I'll find myself crying although I don't know what for. She doesn't visit my home as often anymore.

I feel like I'm starting to slip and it's too much. When I could hide it it was fine because I didn't have to explain anything to anyone, but having people ask me directly why I'm malnourished and lost a lot of weight is leading to outbursts I can't control anymore.  

I was keeping it together pretty well for about 30 years but in the last 2 years my entire friend groupEnded up moving away or finding their own lives all at about the same timeAnd since then I've not really had any contact With other people outside of work 
. I'm glad I was able to keep it together until everyone found their own happiness so I avoided being a burden to them. so I feel like it's as good a time as any to have me just quietly disappear
 I don't know how to tell everybody that the guy that they thought they knew was an act and never existed in the 1st place. I feel darker and darker thoughts more and more often lately and I would honestly be terrified to actually hurt somebody else. And I guess I just wish that there was some safe in easy way out of life because I don't really deserve it.  

Who could possibly go through another 30 years of this shit? How is it that I am the crazy one for not wanting that? 

When people have used up all they had it's less ethical to make those people stay alive than to let us go.",0
"I am a senior in high school and have been miserable for as long as I can remember. I never really got any joy out of anything. Therapy never helped and nothing I try to do works. I hate school, and I’m in an apprenticeship that my dad talked me into which I have never been into construction and now I know I absolutely hate it but my dad won’t let me quit. At the same time I can’t see myself having a future or being happy in the future. I would have killed myself a long time ago but my family would be sad so I’m stuck chugging along and being miserable.",0

"How do I say that I want to lay in bed all day and do nothing? How could I convey to my parents that not wanting to exist is one of few thoughts that I have? I don't want to work, but still my parents force me to, I know this might sound as if I'm lazy. And I am, no doubt in that. 

Tbh I didn't ask to be born, let alone grow up to do stuff that I'm not interested in. If I were to have my dream job, I'd work on it in my pace, but obviously that isn't how it works.

I always come to work, most of the time I'm late, 10-20 mins but I still arrive and work. 

Now I want to run away, cuz I'm tired of them complaining about how I always sleep or that I'm lazy and do nothing all day, that I'm always in my room and not check in on them. That I can't smoke weed to cope with my thoughts.

We only get one life. One. I don't want to spend that time thinking about suicide, and then complain in my head about the options and how painful or too fast it's going to be. 

I don't want to run away, but most of our time we've been together all I hear is an in depth negative comment of how my life is, and contrast to a simple ""I love you."" I do get ""how are you feeling today?"" Or ""what are you up to today?"" But I can't say anything with honesty cuz then they'll start to ask questions that I can't answer without breaking down and shit. 

I almost don't care about family and friends. But I think one fateful day, I'll make that irrational decision and run away. I really am tired of listening to the implications of how bad my life is, and I don't want to hear it anymore. I just need a little push that goes a little too far, then I'll probs snap and head the fuck out. Who knows.

I'm angry at myself and them, and honestly I want to hit stuff and scream at the top of my lungs. But I gotta keep it together, right?
One life.",0
"I've been suicidal in the past and really thought I was better. For some reason started thinking about all the bad/hurtful things I've done to people and within like a week went from feeling generally good to researching ways to kill myself. I feel like a shit person and like there's no good reason for me to live. I just want to stop feeling guilty and I don't know how to do that except kill myself. And I feel like I would kind of deserve it.

I'm scared that even if I make it through this I'm just doomed to being suicidal all my life and eventually I'll be impulsive enough to do it. Even just thinking this way makes me feel guilty because I know how much being suicidal hurts and scares my friends and family. I feel like a bad person for reaching out for help.",1

"i’m a coward. i go through every day with so much pain and tears and pretend everything is alright. i need help and i want help, and i get help. but nothing helps. not meds, not therapy, not my partner, not exercise, not my friends, not my family, not even myself.

"I just can't anymore, my friend that been supporting me to this very moment, she is really kind and I am sorry for what I am about to say but I just don't see the point why shouldn't I just kill myself. I am giving up I just can't bear this anymore. The pressure is too much and I am just so tired of trying over and over and over again. Whatever I do whoever I try to ask nothing will happen. I just don't really see the point why should I keep pushing and keep trying. I haven't slept in days, didn't eat or just did anything productive like homework I have to do. I just don't really see the point right now. Why? Please tell me why? Why?! Nobody cares! My family doesn't I care! I don't have any friends! I am all alone in this! Why am I the only one that suffers! I am always the blamed one! Just... WHY. Nobody can help me. 

I am all alone in this deep shit. 
I have no idea what to do next in my life. There is no point no reason nothing matters we all are going to die so why to live in the first place?

I am sorry",1
"The stability in my mental health comes and goes and right now it’s particularly bad. I have suffered from mental health issues since I was a child, and it was particularly bad in my teenage years. Mental illness along with multiple suicide attempts destroyed my memory, and I feel like losing my teenage years to mental illness impaired me as an adult. 

I’m in university now, I do my work, get decent grades, but I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t enjoy anything, my program is okay but I don’t see my future like so many people do. I struggle to make real connections with people, I am so emotionally unavailable and have hurt so many people leading them on and being unable to commit to them. I also barely enjoy sex and am traumatized from being sexually assaulted after a graduation party. I am wasting away my young adult years now, and soon enough I’ll regret not doing anything with my time. Therapy has never worked for me. I can safely say that I am a ghost of who I was, and who I could’ve been. I pretend and pretend but this part of me always seeps through the cracks. I want it to all end but I don’t think I could ever die, I am an only child and only daughter and it would tear my family apart. I’m just stuck. I’ll never be who I want to be and I feel like I have no options",1
"I know it's late, but I fell into a pool of depression and I realize it now, and I don't know how to get out . Right now its weird but I almost have this part of me wanting to stay depressed and I don't know why. Maybe you would know what I could do?",0
"I'm 49, single and still a virgin believe it or not.

Religion,  Neuroticism , introversion, possible aspergers etc. It is not a simple problem.

I'm a guy. Today is my bday.I bought a can of chlorinated brake cleaner and want to hit it with a welder. That is pretty much what they used in WWI to wipe out the trenches. You smell a fresh cut lawn and a day later you are in a great place. I don't care if I suffer a bit but it is a 100% kill rate. Every single day is suffering for me.

No, I'm not some 19 yo writing this. They have their whole life ahead of them.

Now, it is not like I went out without a fight. In the last few years I watched every self help video. Most were aimed at young guys probably.

I bought clothes.

I have cool hobbies. I work on cars. I fix houses. I like to cook.

I work out. I run and rollerblade - 25 miles is not a problem - I don't even get out of breath. I'm still skinny though and built almost like a teenager. I tried to build muscle but I can't. Men my age look ""substantial."" My neighbor is my age EASILY twice my size. I look at men and I see their wrists and bones, I'm built like a woman. There is something unfixably wrong with me.

I feel like I'm dead and invisible to women. People my age are married with kids and enjoying life. I die inside when I see couples. I missed out on so much in life.  No one even wishes me happy birthday. It is hard to understand what truly being alone is like. It is like death in a way.

I'll never have kids or a family at this point. I just don't want to be the creepy old single man.

I have a computer company and make mid 6 figures, but it brings me zero joy. I'm not trying to brag, and I know other people struggle financially and feel bad but would you want to sit ALONE in front of 4 monitors for 12 hrs a day to make this money? I don't hate the work but why do it if I have no one to share it with?? I feel so alone, like I'm working from hell. I guess people benefit from my work indirectly thru the taxes I pay and the welfare and SNAP they get.

I just need the courage to empty this can and light up the contents. I'll finally be at peace. There is nothing at this point that will make me get better.

There’s times where I get so suicidal that once those thoughts pass and time heals or whatever the fuck I’m left to not give a shit about anything because in my head I should be dead and whatever good happens to me in my life in the future was luck and the rest was destined.

I'm at a point where I've seen no light at the end of the tunnel for quite a while. I've lightly thought about just ending it for some time as well. Tonight I feel it like never before. Still though there is a voice telling me that's stupid and of course I can't do that. But I'm scared that voice will go away someday? I don't know. I don't know how it works. I just want to feel okay again. I looked at some old photos today and there was one where I realized that was the last time I truly felt good. I don't remember being scared or sad or numb or even considering something stupid like this. Not sure what the point of this post is. I just wish there was something I could do to feel good.,0

At least I have a family, but will I just live with my mom forever? without ever having my own house, my own money, my own life?

Everything seems so uninteresting and boring. I'm just so tired of having no motivation to chase my goals. I feel like I once I had the potencial to have a good life, but somewhere on the way I lost my purpose. I'm still young but I feel like I've missed out on so much already.

I hate myself. I hate my inability to live a normal life.

Guess I'll just listen to sad music, drink alcohol, masturbate to porn, and cry myself to sleep tonight like every other day. At least I get to feel something. My mind is so broken, I'm just a piece of trash, a sad excuse for a human being.

I'm a talentless loser. Even If I wanted, I couldn't be succesful in any career or job. I'm too slow, too dumb.

This sub is nice to chat with other people in a similiar situation, but it's also just an illusion. It's not like anyone here cares about me either.

In a way I feel kinda guilty for having those thoughts cause I really think this earth is amazing, I hate myself for wasting my life like that but I think it's the only way i'll feel at peace with myself, though I admit i'm scared of death, I'm scared of the emptiness that will come after. but I'm also scared of the emptiness I feel now, while I'm still breathing yet unable to feel true joy and enjoy it to the fullest. I guess 2019 is my last year. I'm crying as I type this, I just wish things were different, I wish I was much more than I am now. I rarely leave the house but when I do I always feel a bit sadder when I see a couple together or just a group of friends having fun. I know I'm too awkward and weird to live life like they do. I know it's pathetic, but it's just the way it is. And obviously I have big self steem issues and hate the way I look. Every time I look in the mirror I think of how ugly and disgusting I am, I actually try to avoid looking because I know I'll get depressed(more than I usually am on a regular day). I keep writing these posts on reddit because it's better to share the way I'm feeling than just rot in my room, maybe I can find some cool person to chat with and make my existence a bit less miserable? who knows. I really feel sorry for my parents, cause they have no idea how I really feel, and I just can't picture myself saying all this to them. I wish I could kill myself without making my family suffer. They don't need to just because I'm a piece of shit loser

I just can't",0
"M/16, currently going through depression and can't talk to anyone. I've been visiting a psychotherapist for about 2 years and a psychiatrist for several weeks but just decided to stop going there like 6 months ago. I've been diagnosed with social anxiety and have depression but never actually talked about that with anyone, not even with my parents or the therapists. My everyday life goes like this: wake up, survive 7 hours at school, come home, play video games for rest of the day since I don't have anything better to do, cry into sleep, repeat. In school I barely speak to anyone even though I am going in the same class for over 5 years now. Only have 1-2 friends but they mostly only see me as the last choice everytime and only want to meet up when no one else has time. Recently we got someone new in the class and it seems like he had more social contact with the everyone else in the past 3 days than me in the last 5 years. Everyone think's i am introverted and it's kinda true, but only because I get rejected by everyone I even try to talk to and get excluded from everything. When people throw parties, I never get invited but people they barely talk to get invited. My grades are horrible and I am about to get off the school and don't even know what I want to become, since i just stopped caring after I noticed that everyone ignores me and no matter how hard I try to build up a new friendship / contact, I get rejected. I am the kind of person to look at my phone and than ask someone what time it is just so I have somewhat of a social interaction lmao. My parents only see my grades but don't care about my feelings. Because of this happening over many years (basically my whole life) I began to hide behind a emotionless mask. I am not able to express my feelings. nothing. The only thing i can do is laugh (because of something funny, not because i am actually happy) or hate on something. Even if anyone would make me happy, e.g. inviting me to a party, I couldn't show it and still act bored / emotionless because I am too afraid what people would think when I suddenly change and behave like everyone else. I also don't know anymore how to feel empathy. Like i would really like to and empathize with someone but no matter how hard I try it just doesn't work. When someone is sad I can say to myself ""this person is sad"" and feel bad about it, but I cannot comprehend it. I also feel absolutely worthless. For example I don't even say hi/goodbye to most people since i think i am not worth their time. When I meet someone from school outside accidentally, I walk pass them and they walk past me just because I don't want the other person to feel awkward. I know they don't like me and their day is probably ruined just by seeing me so i don't try to force the contact. At this point in my life i noticed that people are just assholes not caring about anyone. Everyone has their perfect life and ignores me so trying further wouldn't change anything. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. In the past i began to think more often about how it would be if just killed myself. I am not really thinking about doing it, but honestly I couldn't care less if I just got hit by a but. I feel like visiting the psychiatrist / therapist wouldn't change anything since I am not being honest to them anyways and don't know how I could be. Anyone good experiences with psychiatrist? Did it help in your case?

This is a throwaway and I just needed to get this off my chest but feel free to comment, I will read it.",1
Im just so tired with life. I wanna have a day off or just maybe kill myself. I am so not seeing the good in everything rn. I have been wanting to cry for a month but I just couldn't? I am so tired. Everything's just really tiring. I just want to cry.,0
"I botched my suicide attempt, but I know where I went wrong. Since then, I've been seriously looking for good reasons to live for the last month, and I feel as useless and worthless as ever. Everyone hates me, and I am a burden at the best of times. Everyone goes out of their way to avoid me. I tell my therapist, and they just tell me not to think about it, like it's somehow a switch I can turn on and off. I've been trying to find healthier ways to cope, and have failed. Now, I've suspended my studies and live at home doing fucking nothing all day, distracting myself from thoughts of self-harming. I contact friends, and they reject and ignore me, even when I've told them all I want is to talk or do small things together. Nobody makes time for me, nobody sees any value in me, and the world would be better off without me.",0
"Supplementary information: College student, physics major; I’ve been dealing with systemic loneliness and depression for a number of years. And as of late, sleep has escaped me, running from my troubles through mathematical gymnastics has exhausted its use. So I ask, “What keeps your momentum on challenging days?”",0
i’ve been going thru a pretty big rough patch i’ve the last month and so the small amount of time i’ve spent at home has been devoted to either drinking smoking or sleeping so it’s become an absolute disaster. so i decided to take the next two days and devote them to cleaning up my apartment. i can’t remember who commented it but i remember seeing someone saying that even just doing one load of laundry or making their bed helps them a lot. i don’t post much in this sub but i sure do lurk a lot and i just wanted to thank everyone that comments and reply’s to stuff. i just want to let you know that you’re not only helping the person who’s post you’re commenting on. you can be helping countless other people like me who just sit back and read and i want to thank this whole community. i don’t know if cleanings gonna help me in the long run and i know it won’t fix all my problems but it’s a start. and idk if whoever’s reading this needs to hear it but the small things matter. even if it’s picking up all your dirty clothes and putting them into the hamper. the smallest things can make a huge difference. if you’re reading this i love you thank you for making this community what it is. we’re gonna all get thru this one step at a time. keep your heads up.,0
"I can’t do this anymore, after moving to 3 different high schools in my last year of school, two core classes of mine are failing grades (one 20 and one 55) and I don’t know what to do. Walking the stage doesn’t even seem appealing to me anymore. All this work I don’t even understand. I should be studying instead of Reddit but I can’t even talk to my girlfriend without feeling embarrassed. Idk why this is so much pressure on me, I don’t even know what to do when I get out of high school. School ends in May and I just don’t know. We have one quarter left of high school. 

This is too much and I’m thinking about things I shouldn’t think about. But this life shit is too much and I can’t handle it anymore. I really can’t. I try and try but nothing clicks. I just can’t Anymore and I’m tired of being an disappointment",1

She wrote me on a piece of paper ways to feel better and never end up in the hospital again, along with her number if I need anything. 3 years later I want to kill myself again, I want to call her but I feel bad unloading my baggage on a random person who probably doesnt even remember I exist. I have no one else. I dont know what to do. I just cut my thighs I wanna shove the switch blade into my throat and I have no one to call besides this random girl who showed me kindness 3 years ago in a loony bin",1
We ended up arguing and he told me I was spoilt and I was being manipulative?? I started crying and kept repeating the same things over and over again.

"So i failed my semester again for second time.
I always was the top grades on my class till i entered college and everything just fall .
Cant focus or study till i failed for first time in my life
And thats where i became depressed.
I was always that strange kid who dont think like a kid or play like them
I was just a smart kid who cant find a meaning for anything.
I wasnt sad but not that happy too .
Even when my dad died i felt nothing even so he tried to kill me twice but still did many good things to me .
I remember i only cried a little when i saw my sis crying really hard for him.
And then i became a depressed person after first year in college .
Going to uni was a hell for me
I just wanted to be alone and sleep forever.
Till recently i found the courage inside me to change my life 
I started nofap and started praying everyday and dieting .. deleted all video games and books or films i had.
Just to change my whole life and felt really good even so i had many faild attembs but tried to improve .
Now i got my grades and failed again..
I dont want to die now .. i finally found something i rly want to do. And want to improve my life
But unfortunally thats it for me
I know my mother gonna have like a heart attack if she saw my grades.. and me myself cant just live anymore.
I had enough of these empty feelings.
Its the 27th of this month
My last day.
Till then i will continue doing my ""life changing"" daily habbits and studying more than ever for last time to prove to myself i can do it like others before suiciding.
I know my english is shit rn im not a native speaker and not emotionaly stable to focus .
Just wanted to say some of the things inside me.",1
"I hate myself so fucking much, it hurts to exist. I'm a pathetic, disgusting excuse for a person and nobody, not even me can stand being around me. I wish I could just be somebody, anybody else.",1
"I can't fucking stand looking at myself in the mirror, my face is round and my cheeks are too chubby. It's a fucking baby face and I see kids younger than me who are able to have defined jawlines, clear skin etc. But no, not me I have moderate acne and I have psoriasis which is starting to flare up. I try to look after myself, but it gets fucking hard getting out of bed and actually looking after myself when I wish that all of this would go away. 

They say I look like my Dad, as if it were a positive aspect, even though he left me when I was a baby. So what? I'm supposed to be grateful for looking like someone who not only was a deadbeat, but also that I should be grateful that I have to look bad for something I couldn't control. I just want to get plastic surgery ASAP. The only reason why I'm working so hard (or at least trying) is to get enough money to fix this shit. I feel so anxious that I feel like when people talk to me, it's out of pity. Why would you talk to someone who looks ugly? My personality doesn't match my body; I can be aspirational, confident at times (shocking right?) , and empathetic. But then I'm a 6'2, slightly chubby piece of shit and whilst that could potentially be fixed, why the fuck is it so hard for me. I swim about 1.5 - 2 miles a week and I eat okay and I can't lose weight. And if I were to get plastic surgery etc., I know that my family would disapprove it, despite that my siblings look so much better than me, seriously. It's not even my family, but my mum, how would she look at me.

But on the other hand this can't happen any longer. It's like my reputation is based on looks when I'm so much more. I want to cry but no one would care because *where's the reward when it isn't a cute ""depressed"" girl to help?* I get judged for being nice, as if I were trying to get some. Could any of you give me your thoughts on plastic surgery. It pisses me off how I would get criticised, like I'm forced to stay this way but others who are naturally fit get to have a good life. I just can't keep going on.

I remember one time I was talking to someone and felt like I wanted to cry because I was thinking ""no one would ever see me like the way they see other people "" (i.e. romantically). I wanted to die, like I always have. But I cannot for certain personal reasons. Hence I am trying to choose the other method: work really hard and if things don't change I **will kill myself regardless of my morals &amp; the consequences etc.** But please, don't comment the bullshit of ""you'll find someone who loves you for your personality"". That is pity and that fucking beats me to the ground. I had a mini panic attack but I tried to contain it to write this. Opinions would be appreciated. I just wanted to make my mum happy and I still managed to fuck it up, no stories about countless girls, popularity, just a sorry piece of shit that my mum has to love. I feel so bad for her.",1
"Today I got brave enough to tell my mom I’m not okay and that I need to go to the hospital. I told her last year that I tried to die when she found my suicide notebook and saw my SH marks on my arm. I haven’t been going to school and she sees me cry almost everyday. But when I told her she said “what made you think like that” and “you can’t think like that”. I said we need to go to the hospital idk what’s going to happen tonight. She said why would I go to the hospital and for what reason, like she doesn’t know. I told her never mind and she just moved on like it was nothing. Like her daughter is nothing. 

I also told my dad today, but all he could ass was “why would u feel the NEED to think like that” and asked me a bunch of questions as if it’s my fault I’m depressed and want to die. 

My friends know that I go through depressive moods and the first time they cared but by now, they don’t even bother to check up on me. 

I’ve been trying to get better by myself but I can’t do it. I stopped SH but that doesn’t make the thought go away. I’m just so tired and alone.

I want everything to stop. To fucking stop for 1 moment.
I want to be alone for 1 day so I would do what the fuck I want. I don't want to see anybody, or to talk to anybody. I just want to be somewhere so no one could reach to talk to me. I want everything to stop. Everything is happening too fast. I feel like I don't have time for anything and I feel tired all the time.

"Very painfully (for me) over the past few months I've lost my best friend. Despite my trying to make things better I couldn't salvage things. We've gone from a really good friendship to barely talking at the end of the day, mostly because of routine. I still care about this person greatly, but its pretty clear thats not the case for this person

Over that time period, my mental state has just gone down the drain. This person was really my only reason to get out of bed in the morning, and be the best version of me that I can be.

I've gone from an A student, to a B student, to a C student, and now im having trouble bringing myself to do any schoolwork at all. I just want to lay down and sleep, even though im getting less than 5 hours a night.

I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past month and I honestly dont know how much longer I can hold out, with the lonliness and the stress given for being an academic student (Canadian system)

I've always been more of a lonely kid, but over this friendship I was shown how much greener the grass is when you have someone to talk to, someone that (seems) to enjoy your company, and can make you smile.",0

"I wake up every morning not wanting to exist. My dad died last month and now I can’t get these thoughts out of my head. He had been depressed for a long time and we often talked about mental health with each other. His mother had committed suicide via overdose when he was quite young. He died of natural causes in his sleep, and I just want to join him. I want to find the power to continue living but every day is a battle and I just don’t know how to cope anymore. My thoughts have been getting darker and darker by the day and I’m beginning to fear myself.

My situation in life it pretty good, I know this. Objectively, I can see it but this feeling that I carry inside is too much. This echoing nothing that carries on from day to day, the overwhelming sadness, the worthlessness... its all too much.   I think about my family and then I feel guilt.. who would find me , who would clean up? Who would pack my shit away or sell it? The damage it would do to my mother only adds to the guilt.  But there’s no way I can stay, living like this hurts. I’m head over heels for someone and every minute I spend with them is lovely. I makes things a little bit easier. But I can feel that my presence is too much sometimes, and the guilt come rushing in. I don’t know how long I can keep this up.",1
"I’ve been suffering from depression and anxiety since like 8th grade. I was molested when I was younger which definitely doesn’t help but honestly I just wanna kill myself cause of my current situation. I just feel so lonely and just downright defeated honestly. I thought I’ve been getting better but realized that I’m actually just regressing in different ways. Instead of being sad about my problems I laugh them off and ignore them leaving them there, instead of being too open with my friends driving them away I now have serious problems not being able to express that I care about people. It’s to the point that apparently (someone else pointed this out) I physically shake when I begin talking about anything wrong with myself. I’m so fucking sick of this you’d think of after 4 YEARS of consistently fighting and trying everything (medicine, mediation, therapy) NOTHING has been accomplished. I always feel like an outsider looking in, never really belonging. Sometimes I think my friends secretly don’t like me and I don’t blame them. How could you like someone who can’t express that they care about you. Never been in an actual relationship, to the point to where when my entire workplace realized I probably wasn’t going to prom so my friend volunteered to go with me which to me feels like a complete pity act as she does have a boyfriend.

Wage slavery at the bottom of the totem pole for another 30 years, no forms or loved ones outside my immediate family, no accomplishments or achievements. Just the long, slow decline into a sad, lonely old age, followed by a meaningless, protracted, lonely  senescence. No one will care for me as an old man, because I’m incapable of caring for people now. I’m doomed to mediocrity and loneliness. Nothing can keep it from happening except ending it all before it gets to that point. I keep thinking ‘Well, I could try and off myself, that would keep things interesting and I could put off that fate for just a little longer.’ But no. Eventually I’ll settle down into a meaningless, soul sucking job, just like everyone else, and wait patiently for death like a good boy.",1

"A month ago I was feeling suicidal. During that period I had a conversation with my son's 16 year old cousin from his mom's side of the family. During our conversation he mentioned to me how much he cares and looks up to me and how I was the only adult he could talk to about girls, his problems, and guitars (shit all teenage boys like to talk about). After our conversation I started thinking about what he said and about all the people in my life that care/depend on me (my son, parents, friends, etc.). And for some reason it seemed like more of a reason to kill myself. I found comfort in knowing that if I killed myself I would be missed. I knew they would be sad for awhile but eventually they would move on and think about all the good times we had. I liked knowing that despite my decision I would die knowing I had an impact on someones life.

I feel as if nobody cares about me, and that life will never get better at all. I've never had anybody i'd consider a true friend really my entire life and now i'm 20, it's starting to really hurt. My social circle consists of two people, to which i'm sure they can't stand me. They're always making stupid jokes and putting me down, but - shit, they're the closest people I have to real friends, and the only people I talk to on a daily basis. I'm at rock bottom right now. Every single friendship I've ever tried to make has just turned people away from me, like i'm some monster. I don't even feel human anymore. I don't feel like I fit in anywhere. I need help.

She is the only woman who would agree to marry me because I'm fat and gross and have no money and the only reason she has stayed is because she knows she can treat my like shit and I wont leave.

"I... I can't imagine dying, it's not something that I want.

And yet these thoughts they still exist and seem to scare and creep and haunt.

Plenty of ways to go about it, some are easy, some are not.

I let the feelings fill me up till I become too deep in thought.





I'm standing on a bridge, I'm looking down at frigid water.

I have come here with a thought, and intentions of self-slaughter.

But when I stand up on the railing, I want someone to come,

Someone to shout and pull me down, stop me from doing something dumb.





I want a stranger's embrace, to reassure me it's okay.

To tell me that it isn't worth it, that the trip's only one-way

I want to bawl and breakdown, in the arms of the unknown.

So I can maybe feel cared about, and not feel so alone...





Now I'm in my room, with a note and rope in hand.

Thinking I'll finally fall through, let my thoughts and mind disband.

But when I step off of that stool, I want my mom to come rush down,

To pull me out my quiet guillotine, and stop my silent drown.





Oh, she'd probably hug and sob, knowing what I had tried to do.

Glad she ran down stairs to check on me, as if had been on cue.

That night would stay with her forever, make her always high alert,

To stop her child from disappearing, or end up permanently hurt.






However in both situations, I would simply end up dead.

That is, if I could follow through with all these thoughts that haunt my head.

"I'm 9 years post the hospitalizations/drug guinea pig era and all the bullshit that comes from not having enough money or insurance to afford professionals that won't prescribe you Jesus or tell you withdrawals don't exist and it's purely psychological. Like, to summarize. I'm 24 now and have managed a normal and social life at school and my restaurant jobs when almost 10 years ago just the thought of leaving my house would give me severe panic attacks. Took a long ass time to fix. I got fit and cute and all that and did the [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) things and socialized with errybody like I learned on the internet and stuff.

A year and a half ago my father suddenly gave me a deadline to leave our apartment. Then pushed it earlier and changed the locks while I was crashing somewhere else. He eventually confessed he's uncomfortable having me in his home because of what I went through and just can't have me around anymore. It's insanely fucked up to have that thrown in your face and then some. ""Our"" became his and everything else his wife's.

When I became homeless periodically this past year, none of my friends or family and family friends helped me when I asked or begged. My relatives cut contact again and most of my friends and people I knew never got back to me while others awkwardly explained how we can't be friends anymore. Even people who knew me personally and what I had gone through just stopped responding to me. In person it was this strange distance from them like I'm a stranger to them. I guess reality started unfolding when things got real. You see your true friends when your heart really needs them.

Unfortunately I had a mental break at work during all this and panicked the fuck out into a depression storm and smashed a glass to use on myself in the back of my restaurant. Everyone was supportive that night and my manager got me in contact with the company's employee support fund stuff to put together money for a deposit for a place and anxiety accommodations at work. The next shifts everybody working there behaved as if I wasn't in the same room and would avoid interacting with me. I was fired a few days later and HR did absolutely nothing. I loved that place and made good money but fucked it up in a snap.

I've been homeless on and off and I couldn't get into any shelters with welfare vouchers or go on SNAP/Section 8, etc because I'm one of those DACA people. The good shelters were always full and the social workers would tell me if I know somewhere I can sleep safe, it's better to do that than the overpopulated homeless shelters here in the NY/NJ metro area. So I'd hide in people's backyards and in abandoned buildings in richer towns at night and hang around parks/libraries during the day. My dad offered to pay rent for my own place for now after he found me sleeping in his garage in 15 degree weather thank fuck for that.

Dozens of online job apps and irl job apps done and still nothing. Then the thoughts come over and over and I don't know what to do. Prozac makes me act on the thoughts while no prozac makes me tolerate them in a panic. I stay off it and just tolerate panicking and crying it away. I can't afford school and my own place while working full-time and don't have enough money to renew my DACA. Future is fucked up. The one support I got doesn't wanna talk to me and pays to keep me away. Oof. My mind calmed down after turning this into a vent..  


TL;DR: Went from mental health recovery and becoming a new person to homeless hot mess without access to welfare or family support.",1
"I come from and live in a country where things are too hard and over half the population is unemployed and suffering mentally. The only people surviving are doing something illegal like pulling the most scams, kidnapping or prostitution. I wish I can indulge in any of this, I have tried to do everything legally even with a degree i seem not to find a job.

It is too hard for me to live on, I can’t afford basic meal or rent and this hardship has set even my family apart.

I am thinking of taking my life as the problem persist. See you guys on the other side if ever succeed.",1
"Hi! I've been battling depression for the past two years, officially diagnosed in summer 2019, currently on medication &amp; therapy. Beating myself up every. single. day. for just being ""lazy"", and ""not being able to get it together"", as well as struggling with the thought that i somehow just tricked everybody (including the doctors) into thinking that i have depression when really i dont. 🥴  
Anyways, after another horrifying therapy session of me complaining that i am really just a piece of shit that only wants to sleep 24/7, wasting her life away not accomplishing anything, my therapist urged me to list all the things which i do DO and sort of look at them from afar and try to practice gratitude and appreciation. Here it is:

1) most days, I am able to make myself brush my teeth and on the good days even take a shower  
2) i could have given up on all work  to kind of ""sleep through"" my depression (my partner can support me financially with no trouble) however as tempting as it is I still do the work (working remotely from home) and recently took on a big project, which I was debating declining but still didn't (no idea how and if  im going to handle it but ill update you on here)  
3) roughly once a week I may feel like putting on makeup and doing my nails  
4) i am able to socialize with my best friend and truly enjoy our evenings together, which is a huge one  
5) i am now able to recognise that the meds do really help and I stopped having hysterical breakdowns and intrusive, disturbing thoughts  
6) i have never missed a day of therapy  
7) even though my sleep schedule is non-existence (sleeping every 4 hours during the course of a day) I still pull myself out of bed, have breakfast, maybe out on some clothes and go out to work in a cafe, even if for just an hour

I think that's about it. I do feel better. Will update on my progress.",0
"I feel as if people are ignoring me and what I say now. Some of my friends have become really popular and whenever I say hi or call their name they either look at me like they don't know me or just flat out disregard that I'm even talking to them. Barely a few friends have stuck with me at this point. My crush has seen me at my desk when I'm going through a rough time but she just ignores me.  She has talked to me frequently but it just seems that she doesn't care. One of my friends who I thought was my friend leaked out that I'm autistic and have ADHD as well as I take medications for that every day. Now, whenever I walk around school people look at me and laugh while talking shit about me. Some have called me a freak and leave the school and go to a mental asylum. I've been called a mistake so many times. All this has been affecting me emotionally and physically. This has been making my depression worse and has increased my levels of anxiety. I've been having more anxiety attacks since this all started. Everything around me is starting to become meaningless to me. Nothing other than my mom, my dog, and my little brother give me a genuine source of happiness. The people at my school have made me feel even more worthless than I was before this. I want to feel accepted by someone other than my family. (I consider my friends family as well) People who don't talk shit about me or don't look at me strangely just disregard I'm there. Maybe their all right, maybe I really am just a mistake. ",0
"First of all, some details about me. I am 25 years old male in my last semester of college (yaaay!) and I call myself protypal geek - introverted IT guy who loves fantasy and Sci-fi. I am from a small European country. 

I am struggling with a feeling I can't quite name. Most of the time I feel incomplete, like some vital piece of me is missing. This feeling goes away and the world turns brighter the minute I start feeling attracted to someone. Just the possibility of having a girlfriend makes me happy, that feeling of hope. And the minute I lose that hope.. well.. hello darkness my old friend.

I've read the usual advice ""you need to be complete by yourself, find a new hobby or something that makes you happy"". I've tried, really tried. It's possible to silence it, but not remove it. When I focus on work, or on a game, a book, anything I need to put my mind on, it goes away. Unless I have a really bad day, then I need to drill through it if I want to get something done.

It kinda sounds like depression triggered by loneliness, is something like that even possible? It also have pretty firm grasp on my life, on my actions to be precise. I am driven to look for at least that hope. I am currently trying to expand my social circle. I found out that there is a pretty big fantasy/LARP community in our country. Problem is that I am going in with finding a girlfriend as my main goal. Yeah I will probably have lots of fun, but that's secondary. Rationally it sounds pretty bonkers.

One last thing I should probably mention is that I had girlfriends in the past, but with big pauses between them. The shortest pause was half a year but a standard pause is around two years which is also for how long I am alone now. One of my theories is that all this is happening because I am operating in scarcity mindset. 

I am looking for someone who can relate, maybe even help me put a name on it. I want to understand it.",0
"I’m a college student who has suffered with depression my entire life.

"Please ignore my grammatical errors
 And thank you if you are reading this 

So the thing is I am trying so hard to be happy and ignore the toxic people in life but the thing is I don't have friends, not a girlfriend. This is eating me inside making me awkward around people which gives the weird vibe around people. I am anxious around people which make me a different human which make more difficult to make friends.  

There were some people in my life which I thought would stay around me so I ignored toxicity and thought it will become better but it backfired me because when I tried to talk to them about what they have done to me they turned the table around me and blamed me for all. Now I don't know how to make myself innocent and they have played with my emotions and I want to prove myself and want pay for there deeds 

I am trying so hard to don't give a f*ck but overthinking is killing me and I am losing all my self-confidence and self-respect.",0

"Preface, I'm a bit drunk rn, it helps numb this pain.

A girl I knew and I had hooked up with in the past, then became friends with commit suicide recently. We weren't close but I'd consider her a special friend to me. We rarely saw each other, but when we did we had the best banter known to man.  


I'm doing great in school, have a girlfriend, got internships lined up and was happy before this. But now, since she commit suicide, the only thing that makes sense to me is to kill myself. I've had depressive episodes before but this feels different. Everytime my thoughts are blank or I zone out, my first thought is the fact she is actually gone. Last time I tried to commit suicide was 5 years ago, and even then it wasn't this impactful.

&amp;#x200B;

For some reason this girl's suicide has really fucked with me and makes me feel like suicide is a reasonable option. It makes me feel like I have a new purpose. I feel like there is something extraordinary waiting for me. I almost feel as if she is waiting for me.

&amp;#x200B;

I got home in a cab and cried the entire way. The cab driver said nothing. I said nothing. When he looked at me I felt he had accepted my fate as I had. Perhaps there is more, perhaps there isn't. But I do want to cry more, but I'm not close enough to the girl to deserve pity.

&amp;#x200B;

As I am typing this out I feel better.  I feel as if I do not need to die right now but I do crave death. Just not at my hand. I accept being murdered, I accept an accident.

And I took three bad grades(3 Fs), lower than I ever took, and my parents don't believe me with anything and screaming and threatening me ...

No matter how some people would try to help me...

"For the last 7 years ive had horrible stomach problems, i throw up atleast 4 days every week, i feel nauseous constantly, i have a ton of pain in my stomach, and after all these years ive gotten so malnourished and worn out that every part of my body is in pain. Ive seen numerous Gi specialists who have all told me that im in perfect health, despite their best efforts nothing they have tried has ever worked. The last specialist i saw basically told me that everything had been tried and there was nothing left for him to do, he gave me a few meds to try but they didnt help at all. Ive been seeking help with my mental health for over 5 years but in the end everyone ive seen has either dismissed me immediately or kicked me out after a year of not helping. The last time i tried to get help i ended up getting seen for maybe 5 minutes then told i had mild depression and given a recommendation to take back to my GP. The final nail in the coffin was yesterday when i went to see an ENT after over a year of waiting, ive had what i thought was sinusitis but just like every other doctor he told me i was perfectly healthy and that he couldnt help me. Honestly the ""sinus infection"" was the one thing i thought i actually understood but now that even that isnt real my mind just feels shattered. I thought i could atleast make it through the year, hopefully see another specialist and try even more tests but now i just cant see the point. All its going to bring is more frustration and depression, i feel like i should just do everyone a favor and kill myself. Everyone would be much better off without a piece of shit like me around, i know my parents would be upset for a while but in the end they would be far more happy if i was gone. Anyways i know nobody gives a shit but i just needed a place to vent.",1

"(Disclaimer that I get suicidal ideation in a more ongoing ""casual"" form, so might not resonate with everyone.)

What I would give for someone to say, ""I understand you're struggling, and I will understand if you choose to end it.""

Even my friends who get suicidal ideation come from a perspective of it being something you'll get through. They talk about how meds have helped them. Or about how they've become more resilient. And they'll say they'll help and encourage you the whole way.

But I don't want someone to encourage me. I want someone to sit with me and say, ""Yeah that really sucks."" To say, ""It's okay if you can't handle it."" Or even, ""I'll help you end the pain.""

I wouldn't do anything, would never take them up on it. But it would be so incredibly validating. 

I want to be heard; I want to be understood. I'm on meds, I'm in therapy, I'm resilient. I know I'm doing all the right things. Just please stop telling me I'm going to be okay, and listen to me when I say I'm not.",1
"On paper things should seem fine, the few people I've told I want to kill myself on a constant basis brush it off as me being hyperbolic or something. I think about suicide every day and I have for a very long time. Every day is just a physical underlying pain, that I can't really pinpoint.  I just want it to stop. The depression or whatever, doesn't ever go away, no matter if I change my work, have money or dont, with or without romantic partners, or how my social life is doing. I can't seem to dig out any actual real trauma. I just want to die, and I think about it all of the time, but I'm just too much of a coward to go through with it, so far. I just want help to end this.",1
"The first time I ever imagined killing myself I was 8 years old. Since then all I’ve ever done is hurt people and been hurt by people. Even before then, all I can ever remember knowing was abuse.

"This morning my mom took me to a psychiatrist appointment I’ve been waiting for for months. Immediately, he began questioning why I was there when I had good grades in school and seemed fine. Also asked if I was restless all the time and I said yes, and he told me no I wasn’t because I wasn’t fidgeting at that point (even though I was shaking and playing with my Kleenex) Then my mom mentioned the eating disorder clinic I’ve been going to and he asked my bmi and I’m not allowed to know it, so he made me stand up and started patting me down to get a “feel for my weight”. By this point I was crying and he just continued to make me feel like I was faking it or shouldn’t be there. It took me 6 years to speak up about this and now I’m regretting it because I always feared I would be told that I was overreacting or faking it. Was uncomfortable the whole time too because he was sitting with like less than a metre between us and. I have to go see him again in a few weeks and I’m so terrified, I’m still crying and it’s been 3 hours.

My state was tolerable. Manageable. I stopped self harming more than a year and a half ago. I'm proud of that, even if that long stretch came from a bad relapse... I don't want to ruin it now. I really don't.

The thing is, my mental state has been deteriorating over the past few months... Year? More? I don't even know... Occasional thoughts of hurting myself I can ignore and move on from. But they, like the happy times, are usually fleeting. As are worse thoughts. Now... It's persistent. And fighting it is exhausting. Reached a point yesterday where I honestly did not feel safe. So I called. 111 put me onto the rapid response team. Had a meeting today. Have a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Have to see them ever day for a little under two weeks.

But that doesn't stop the thoughts... I feel guilty because I feel like I'm taking valuable resources away from someone else who needs them. But I'm also worried... I lose chunks of time... My memory is crap and I can forget things minutes later sometimes (it's intermittent)... I have no energy or drive to do... Anything... I can't focus on conversations and constantly have to ask people to repeat themselves. I've been getting persistent chest pains and my vision is just... Weird. I can't explain completely. And I'm constantly fighting the need to do... Something. I need to hurt. But I can't let myself. And it's exhausting.

So all these strategies coming in and I keep asking myself... I don't even want help. Or do I? I don't know. I know I reached out and I know I can't keep doing this without professional help. My SO also can't keep up with this... He isn't a professional and it's so unfair to him. I want to be better for him as well as... I just want to be normal... To function. But all this outside help. It feels like too much, too fast... It would be easier to just... Not... To continue to exist and let whatever will happen just happen...",0

"I want to die but my life isn't even that difficult, there are people in worse situation than me. I feel guilty for wanting to die, knowing that. I should be grateful for everything I have, knowing there are people who don't have access to food, etc but I'm not. I want help but I don't feel like I deserve it because there and people in a worse state than me. I want to tell my friends/family that I want to die, but I don't want to look like an attention seeker so I don't tell them. The only thing stopping me from jumping off 19 storeys is my cowardice, everyday feels so repetitive and boring that I might just jump one day in front of everybody, to see if they would care. I feel so guilty that people have to deal with me, I'm a nuisance. I don't feel that anything I do in life would matter as I will eventually die, like everybody else. I keep letting everybody down.

"I have a beautiful wife and 2 year old son. A great job. Had a good childhood. But I’ve been dealing with depression for years. I’m extremely unhappy.

I've been in and out of various treatments since then. Lost my job and most of my friends. Buried in medical debt. Lost my car today.

I was struggling even when things were going well, but now I'm out of straws to grasp at. I don't like myself. I don't even respect myself. I'm embarrassed of the life I've lived. I can't keep myself sober, and, frankly, I'm out of reasons to bother trying. I like to say I won't make another attempt because of my dad, but some days I think the real reason is because I just haven't stockpiled enough pills yet.

"(25M) I've been dealing with depression since I was about 14. I've been to countless therapists/doctors and have never had any relief. Throughout that time I've battled the urge to end my life and the only thing that seems to stop me is the guilt of hurting my family, in particular my mum.

I feel like such an ungrateful piece of garbage for what I've put her though and I know she deserves better than me.

She unfortunately isn't the only one. I recently ended it with my girlfriend because I couldn't stand what I was doing to her emotionally, the burden of having to deal with me day after day is exhausting and its simply not fair to ask that of her.

I've had gfs in the past but she is the only one I've ever truly loved, I genuinely believe that she is/was the one, but I can't condemn her to a life with me.
She simply deserves better. She's the most wonderful person I've ever known, and she should be with someone who can make her happy.

I wish she hated me, so that she doesn't feel guilt or sadness when I die.

"Hi, so my friend has depression and an eating disorder of some kind. I had depression last year but got out of it and last time I selfharmed was maybe 6 months ago. I and the few people that know about her problems have tried to help her and it helped a little but got bad again. She was one of my bestfriends but she makes me depressed and anxious now and I can’t handel it. But none of the people that she has told can really help her anymore because we are too exhausted and can’t risk our own health. She won’t get professional help and 70% of what she talks about is her bad eating habits or selfharm/depression.

She’s always too close to me and I have said to her that I need my personal space but she doesn’t seem to understand. I want to help her but It’s just too much right now. When we talked about her needing professional help she said that she got professional help but it got too busy just before she could get better. She ment me, I was the ”professional” help. I have been busy so I haven’t talked to her outside of school that much and I just feel like she tried to make me feel bad that she almost got better and then I got busy. Like I can’t use all my free time on you, I have my own problems and life too. She doesn’t respect my boundaries and I feel like she has gotten between me and my bestfriends. I feel like I’m a bad friend but I have to choose my health first. I need some space from her but I can’t get any. I need advice! But remember, if you are depressed please get help and talk to someone, it truly helps. This is why professional help is so good, friends can help to some extent but they aren’t professionals that know how to handel these things in the best way. I just have it hard because I’m still healing and it’s not good for me right now personally.

Sorry for bad grammar",0
"To everyone out there, the people who have suffered from depression, perhaps for many years. This is my first post, I am, like so many of you lying in bed, have been for many months, known this state for decades.

You are not alone. And whoever you believe yourself to be right now that is not true. remember the person you were when you were fine, happy, in a better place. Feel it, embody that. I know that I am holding on to it. And if life has been mostly dark it helps to believe that experiences of happiness and joy exist somewhere outside of this state...just like Martin Luther king believed in his dreams even at that particular time it seemed impossible.

I do not know what caused you to land hard in this state, for me it was relationship loss, failure, deep loneliness and isolation-I have no family and lost my relationship/friendships to depression- people left-, though life circumstances (financial issues/living environment and of course the abusive childhood) AND my reactions to them e.g. blaming myself, self-sabotage, feeling futile, discouraged, bad habits, unhelpful implicit relational and emotional patterns that keep repeating. Whatever it is that led into this black hole. I guess the situation gets more frustrating with every attempt to heal that did not work. I tried many medications (almost all of them), several psychiatric stays, several years of therapy (CBT, depth psychology), the Hoffmann process, all kinds of meditations, body work, “giving up and surrender”, Eckhart tolle etc you name it.. they all helped a little but nothing really worked in the long term.

And it sucks that nothing seem to work permanently. 

However, I deeply believe that there is meaning imprinted in everyone’s heart. What is your life worth living? What would you like to experience?  If you we’re dying what really matters to you?Lying in bed, can you imagine and feel experiencing it? The happiness, the joy, whatever it is you wish for? In every ayahuasca experience and every other methods that helped me temporary what really helped was seeing clearly this pattern of depression replaying (the thoughts, the emotional pain, the energetic pattern) and then break free of it for a while until familiar patterns re-emerge. It is like getting on a diet and putting on weight again... rebuilding relationships is a huge part of my recovery. So I guess I wanted to reach out to you and ask the question what dreams do you have today? How can you believe in them in your head first and in your body? Often the despair is exactly next to this dream. But keep building that belief. You are not alone, please do not give up. I will not either.",0
"I've been realizing some damn hard truths about myself. I've never been happy, ever since I was a little kid I felt like I was ""bad"". You know how children play ""house"" and it can be used in therapy to evaluate their outlook and issues? When I was a kid, I would play ""house"" with my fingers: there was the mom, dad, brother, and sister (me, the pinky finger). Each time, everyone would gang up on and beat up the sister. I just remembered that I used to ""play"" that game the other day - I don't think I have any real excuse for that, I was anxious as hell from a young age and irritable as fuck, but what kind of kid thinks of that shit? I was messed up back then.


I've talked to professionals. They seem to think that this is more than anxiety and depression. They say that I've faced a lot of trauma in my life. I suppose it makes sense. My parents were heavily abused during their childhoods, my mom even tried to kill herself as a young kid. My dad was an abusive alcoholic for most of my childhood. He and my mom would fight a lot - they would swear at each other, he would hit and throw things at her, she would scream at him and they would usually tell each other to go to Hell or drop dead. My dad was verbally abusive, and I remember he would hit my brother too. I presume he hit me, but I don't remember. All I remember is that when I was a teenager, he got so angry at me that he held me down on the couch. I was so detached, all I thought was how he was so angry he was about to drool on me, and how it was gross. I love my parents, despite their flaws. I just don't like them. We fight all the time. When I was younger, I remember that often when I got into a row with one parent, the other would get involved and then they would fight with each other. They would say horrible things like what I said above. They would say awful things to me too, like how once I was mad and my mom said I should look in the mirror to see how ugly I look. She would tell me to ""get out of her sight"" a lot. I get called a bitch at times. I'm told I treat them horrible, and I hate myself even more when they say that. Ugh. On the note of trauma, I realized earlier this year that I was repeatedly raped (oral, not vaginal) by my ex over the course of a year or so. That's also been tough to process.

It's fucked because I know my parents love me. They read to me as a child, they taught me to be independent. They just want me to be happy. But there's just always been something missing, I guess.

I realized that I may be in a chronic state of mild dissociation. I often feel detached from my body, my emotions, my environment, other people. I feel like I'm in a fog. My limbs aren't quite attached to my body, I feel floaty or dizzy. Weak and shaky. At times I dissociate harder, and I go totally numb. Can't move. Can't talk. Things look smaller, I float above or behind my body. My vision gets weird. It's scary yet comfortable because I'm aware that I'm further detached from myself and in a limbo for an hour. It fades and I get a headache, my body hurts, and I'm exhausted. Then it's back to reality, and I feel even more off for the rest of the day. I've noticed I also mildly dissociate when I try to sleep. My head is disconnected from my body, my limbs feel large or disconnect from my body. It's incredibly disturbing and I don't know why it happens. I never even realized I apparently dissociate until I started thinking about my childhood. Experienced some crazy depersonalization and derealization. When it happened, I realized that it was *very* familiar and I remembered doing it a lot as a kid. That realization fucked me up.


What really makes me feel crazy is the apparent somatic symptoms. I developed chronic visual snow and headaches as a teenager. I also started getting ocular migraines. Numerous tests and exams showed that all is well - it's just stress. My mouth has been hurting for the past year, as well. I even got an extra wisdom tooth removed, thinking that was the source of the pain. Nope. The pain persists, and is very noticeable when I'm stressed. Xrays and exams show that things are fine. I feel like a damn hypochondriac or like I'm malingering...but this is all very real to me.


I feel weak a lot. I am also dizzy, or like my brain is rotting, or stuffed with cotton/fog. My head is never ""clear"". I can't focus on much. Working is difficult. I can't truly interact with friends or family anymore. My weight has been all over. Due to horrible anxiety, I had lost a third of my body weight in 9 months. When I fell into this double depression, I lost 14 pounds in 2 weeks. Then someone I care about confronted me about the seriousness of it all. I tried to maintain my weight, and it worked for a month. Then I had a little breakdown and lost 7 pounds in 5 days. Started an antidepressant and became apathetic as hell - had an aborted suicide attempt and binge ate like crazy even though I wasn't hungry. I was like ""fuck it I deserve to gain weight and look disgusting"". I've gained 10 pounds in a week. I hate myself so much.


The more I realize, the more I hate myself. I've tried six or seven antidepressants, I've tried therapy a few times and am trying again. On another med right now. It all feels so damn hopeless. I've wanted to die since I was 13, and every day is just full of more pain and despair. 


People tell me not to give up on myself, but it gets more and more tempting as time goes on. Ever since I was 15, I always had a strong feeling I would die by suicide. I figured I wouldn't kill myself until I was 27 or 28, but things are becoming more disasterous. I just wish I had the courage to end this suffering soon. I feel like such a disgusting coward and a fraud. I'm ashamed to exist, to take up space in this world.",1
"Hi

I'm going to be seeing a therapist for the first time in a while, at the urging of my partner. For a long time, I've felt like my problems did not warrant a therapy session, so I am just now taking my situation more seriously. I can't continue on like this and I know it. so I'm going.

My problem is that I have minimal insurance (500$ for the year for mental health). My new therapist works on a sliding scale, but I don't know how much to pay. She's given me 100$ as an option, then I got overwhelmed and she told me to think about what I thought was fair. I might be able to get on my partner's insurance at some point, but I have no idea when,

I'm now terrified of not being able to afford therapy, because I can feel myself getting close to a breaking point.

If its over text its just stuff like ""wow"",  ""nice"",  ""lol"",  ""cool"". You can just tell they arent interested because as soon as the topic changes they are so much more involved. Honestly its making me feel so bitter, it feels like no one cares enough to try and get involved with the interests which mean the most to me. I can be surrounded by people but I feel so alone because I know no one cares. I know no one cares about me. No one cares about my interests. Honestly its just gotten really sad.

I don’t wanna get into all my problems and shit but life has been so unfair and I know other people have problems, and I always think “well at least they aren’t dead” because some of my friends have lost parents and siblings but maybe what I have is worse because I still see them but I don’t see themselves anymore because they aren’t and never will be the same.",0
"21. University student. Stressed to the max with zero support system whatsoever. I was homeless before college (and in college) and moved across the country right after high school, cutting off contact with my abusive family. Been suicidal most of the time since being in college and in high school but still here. Came out and got a girlfriend, still nothing got better. We were homeless together for a while and experienced a lot together, been with each other for over two years. She’s an alcoholic though and because it’s a progressive disease things got worse over time and began to hit a low October/November 2019. Anyone who’s got experience with an alcoholic loved one knows how awful it gets. I never thought things could get so much worse, but then I never thought I’d be a suicidally depressed 21 year old and I also never thought I’d date an alcoholic. It has a way of destroying your soul unlike anything else you’ll ever experience, and I’ve been abused since I was an infant. I put aside my own sense of self, my own needs and well being to focus on hers while my heart got ripped out, stomped on, and spat on repeatedly. I’ve been thinking about offing myself for a very long time. I don’t see an end to the suffering I’ve experienced in my lifetime. My girlfriend started her journey with sobriety two weeks ago (at least I believe, don’t know what to really think these days) and it feels like while she’s making leaps and bounds with things I begged her to do for months I’m stuck behind and can’t get my mind out of the gutter from when things were really, really bad. I know things take time but I’m tired of waiting for when life gets “good”. I used to think happiness was a personal choice and I still believe that a little bit, but with all the garbage I’ve experienced in my 21 years I’m mostly just of the opinion that some of us are dealt horrible hands in life and doomed from the start. While I “have” people in my life who care about me I will never have the kind of person who cares about and supports others to the extent that I do. And maybe that’s a good thing, because doing so has made me lose everything about myself. But now my glass is empty and there’s nothing to pour into it. I’m tired of struggling every day. Suicide seems like the only way off this terrible ride for me and it has felt that way for years.",1
I feel like life is too hard but I' not sure whether to kill myself. I've been to a mental hospital for appointments and medication but I want to be sectioned instead of forced to live in the normal everyday life that everyone else is living. Anyone know how I can get in?,1
"I just finished half of my current career... Pretty much four semesters, and almost nothing has changed.

Being honest, I've been trying to hold on for three and a half years after that Asperger misdiagnosis, but eventually it becomes unbearable... I keep thinking that some people treat me in a more child like way, or as if I were disabled, or just talking to me when we are face or face or for college stuff, but no more than that.

My mom has been trying to understand, but she says it's difficult, because she's a more self sufficient person, and she doesn't understand why I'm so obsessed with friendship.

Now I'll go to my psychologist in a few days, and I don't know how to make her understand as well... Sometimes, I think my problem isn't something that can be fixed by just believing in myself.

It's the main reason I want to die, it's the main reason I lost a lot of things and people in these past years... It destroyed my life, and I don't know how to make my mom and psychologist understand that.

I don't think I'll be able to withstand that forever. For now I can, but I feel that if the future will be the same, eventually I'll break down or have a nervous breakdown...

Believe me, it hurts to realize everything you lost, I know, it was my fault for saying it, I didn't know the consequences it would bring...

I'm tired of feeling like this, not being able to say what I really want to say to others, feeling treated like a child, trying to explain and almost no one understands... I'm not saying this because I want to bother people or to complain about life, I'm saying this because I feel like I'm very stunted compared to other people around my age, because they may think I'm a weirdo...",1
"I wish more than anything that I could go to bed tonight and peacefully fall into a forever slumber. No pain, no thought just endless peace. Dreaming about the person I love the most and my family.

"Hey everyone,

I have a friend who lost her brother to suicide before Thanksgiving.

She's been having bouts of depression, and I want to know how I can help her. Our work therapy hasn't helped her at all by dismissing her after 3 sessions by assuming she ""seems fine."" She has taken the first step by opening up to me.

Thank you in advance to those who take the time to help.",1
Then I bet there would be people that would stay alive due to the limited amount of suffering and happiness that they could feel but then again it's all a pipe dream. Funny how some pipe dreams would really help humanity and David Pearce abolition of suffering idea would be the best suicide prevention tool ever.,1
"i am so goddamn hopeless. all i want to do is end it. i could have a happy life, i know that, but now is hard enough to make me not want that. i had a psychiatrist appointment scheduled on the 7th, but my dad found out and is in a fight with my mom about it, who keeps coming into my room to tell me its all my fault because i don't want to try to convince my father that i DESERVE to seek treatment for already diagnosed depression and ocd. i am tired. nothing ever gets better. tonight might be the night i go. i fucking hope so anyway.",1
Im feeling so good and wouldn’t even think about suicide and then hours go by and I don’t remember what really happens but I feel like i can’t take it anymore.  I don’t really know how I got from point a to b but i did and i feel so awful and suicide becomes a realistic feeling and temptation.,1

"Talked to my mom today about a test I have today that I was stressing over. And the conversation turned into me wasting my potential (all in love). But what pisses me off is this just ""get over it"" mentality like what's taking me so long. And her and I both know I have to get on top of things but when you had depression for 8 years and counting this is not something you just overcome in a short period of time.

And probably what pisses me off the most is the fact she's right bc her and I both know time doesn't wait for anyone. I don't have the luxury to keep performing at the level I'm currently am.

All of this is just frustrating, ik the answer it's just a matter of applying myself.",0
"I hate myself. Because of one stupid mistake - I could have just ruined my future career. My dream career. All because I didn't hand in my report on time. I want to fucking end it all.

"I’ve kind of resigned myself to the fact that I’m never going to be comfortable and satisfied with who I am because of how other people view me. My solutions to this are to just close myself off from people in general and accept my depression. Is accepting your depression bad? I’ve tried therapy and drugs, they didn’t work and I’ve found that I prefer myself unmedicated anyway. I’ve just accepted it as part of me, it’s who I am.

I don’t know if it’s linked to depression, because I’ve only been really depressed for about 8 months but had mild depression for about 3 years. I remember always having this phenomenon. It’s so noticeable too, like if I fake being sick to stay home, the second I know I’m able to my mind and body just become instantly awake.",0
"Everything I've had in life has slowly been ruined by anxiety.  


Friends I used to talk with constantly are now either gone or distant because I just can't keep up with them anymore. I've separated from so much of my family because of my own choices and shitty habits. I'm unable to beat them. For years I've wanted to reconnect with the people I shut out, but I've become trapped in a self-destructive cycle where I'm too ashamed to admit my problems to the same people I just want to make proud.  


I've lost every job the same way. Whether it's throwing up in the bathrooms at work or failing to muster up the courage to even call in sick, it finds its place in the worst possible ways without fail.  
It's been like this for years. I live at home with no job, no car, not even highschool degree four years after I should have graduated. I don't even have a driver's licence.   
I've been hospitalized twice, both times in relation to this problem that just won't go away. Nothing works.

"You claw your way up and then life throws you back down. And even if it's because of the stupidity, ignorance, or complete inconsiderance of another human, it's just NOT acceptable to exact your own justice upon them. You're just fucking expected to keep your head fucking down and keep pushing fucking anyways. Even if you keep getting kicked whole your down. Nope, not allowed to make others pay, you're just supposed to up and move on from it. It's fucked. It's completely fucked. 

At this point I just want to get ahead and I'm starting to think the best way to do that is to step all over people and completely exploit them for my own benefit. I don't have a reason to give a fuck about them anymore. It's all bullshit anyways though. I'm just done with this life. I'm sick of fucking getting up and moving. I'm sick of hearing other humans speak. I fucking hate every goddamn person on the planet. They are all shit.",1

"Today was not a good day. I’ve been doing well for almost five months now and today was enough to put me back in a dark place. 

For those of you who monitor these posts to give advice, I’d really appreciate some right about now. I just don’t know how to control these urges anymore. 

I have a bad tendency to use alcohol to numb these feelings and thoughts. I know it’s not a good method. But it’s one that’s worked for me in the past.

What has worked for you in the past? How do you feel better when you’ve been beaten into submission again? What do you do? How do you distract yourself? How do you avoid these dark tendencies?

I’m just so afraid of falling back into the hole of depression. I thought I had escaped it, but like always, it has a magnificent ability to be able to drag me back down.

Please. I’d appreciate any positive feedback the community has. I’m just so tired of feeling this way.",1
"I hate who I am. I've lived a perfectly good life, had loving parents, was never bullied, whatever. Right now I have plenty of friends, a decent social life. I have no excuse for feeling how I feel and I just constantly beat myself up for it. Yet here we are, me just doing drugs every night and eating shitty food in the hopes that they'll kill me faster. Pretty much given up on college, no clue how I'm ever gonna graduate, but not like it matters since I'm not doing anything with my life anyway. Next phase is to get some dead end job till death finally comes. Not much to look forward to. Would have offed myself long ago if it wasn't for my parents, I can't give them the pain of losing their only child to suicide. I also don't wanna hurt my friends, but I'm doing a pretty good job of distancing myself from them so that probably won't be an issue in the future. Living for others sucks, but I mean, what other choice do I have?  I'm definitely not gonna live for myself when the time comes.

So here I am just patiently waiting death. For the most part I've stopped feeling anything. Some days (today) it just hits me like a train, but I usually wake up, just lumber through the whole day doing what's ""expected"" of me, all fake smiles and funny jokes to make people think that I'm normal. Then I come back, waste time with videos games or drugs, sleep, rinse and repeat. I've tried to start a hobby, but I always lose motivation, try to talk to people, but only exchange empty words. Don't see my condition improving in any way (not like it's possible anyway). Life sucks, it always has and always will. I just really hope that I don't get the chance to make it to 30 years.

I despise this cycle, I hate that you're forced to participate, and I hate that people tell you that you're the one with ""a problem"" for thinking that things shouldn't be this way. Isn't it cruel to keep someone in misery when relief is so easily available? But of course, forcing them to suffer is obviously the moral choice here. So I guess suffer I will, cause apparently society decided that this was the right choice. 

In short, all I'm looking forward to is the day that I'll be able to kill myself guilt free, hope it'll come sooner rather than later.",1
"Hey people, I'm M17 and I struggle with depression for quit a long time. For a few months I thought everything would get better. But lately my mental health got worse and I'm really thinking about suicide very often (several times a day) .

"Failing half my classes, same as last semester, going to drop out of college at the end of the semester with no life direction, no ambition, no motivation, no desires, dreams, will to live. I don’t know how I’m going to hide the scars covering my arm during the summer when it’s 100 fucking degrees out. I’ve worn short sleeve shirts my whole life almost never wearing long sleeves (not counting hoodies/coats/etc) so I’ll definitely receive lots of questions if I’m sweating my ass off wearing a long sleeve shirt for no reason during hot summer days. 

Don’t really see a way out of this shitty life other than killing myself. Mom asked me a couple weeks ago where I see myself in 10 years. I told her I didn’t know, but all I could think was that I don’t see any scenario where I’m alive in 10 years. Might as well just off myself now before everything goes to shit... sorry... before everything gets even shittier just like it always does. Cutting my hand right now cause I know it won’t leave scars like are on my arm. Don’t even know why I’m writing this. Maybe I just need to rant or get this off my chest. Maybe some part, hidden deep away inside me, actually believes typing this out will help.

I block all my problems out and just isolate myself. I don’t open up to anyone I just say I’m fine. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t care about anything anymore. Whatever happens I just don’t care nothing bothers me or phases me I’ve been so unhappy for so long and no one even knows what goes on in my mind. I feel like it’s never ending.

One example of my ridiculous hypocrisy was when I ranted about my friend who’s in a terrible family situation. I constantly insulted him and said that he was faking depression and begging for attention. What he was doing was begging for sympathy and I had no right to be saying anything because people who are depressed are more inclined to act that way. And even now I make fun of him. I don’t know what is wrong with me except for everything. And now I’m the one begging for sympathy. And I’m somewhat glad that nobody gives it to me because I don’t deserve sympathy.

"Okay so I have absolutely no one to talk to, so forgive me for ranting here and making little to no sense. I just really need to get things off my chest. 

I really want to die. I’ve reached the point where I would be fine with a car crashing into mine and killing me, or being shot, or getting a terminal illness; I’m not picky over how I die, I just want to vanish from Earth. And I’m too much of a coward to do it myself, though I think about it all the time. My family has grown attached to me, despite the fact that they used to hate my guts during my teenage years. I fixed my relationship with them, and I know dying would hurt them but I’m a selfish idiot. 

I recently started college and it’s awful. I used to be a great student in high school, the type of student teachers praise by saying they have a great future ahead of them. But along the way I fucked up. I feel dumber and dumber each day, I see my classmates learning quick while I struggle to understand a simple class. I can barely finish assignments on time and each day I find less reasons to finish them. I fear failing my classes, I’ve never failed one before but at the rate this is going I probably will. My family has put so many high expectations on me, and I’ve always known I would never meet them. 
I’m not even studying what I wanted because my mother disapproved of my original career choice. I wanted to study physics, but she made me study electronic engineering. 
The firsts exams were awful, I know I still have time to recover from my pitifully mediocre scores but I seriously doubt I will. 

I have no friends, my personality is awful and I never learned how to talk to people, I’m too awkward. I’m also incredibly hideous and fat, there’s nothing I like about myself. I absolutely loathe everything about myself. There’s no redeeming quality about me. I used to think I was smart but it’s clear I’m a dumb idiot that never should had been born. I wish my mother aborted me when she had the chance. I’m just a fucking waste of space. 

I can’t even cry anymore. Hell, I don’t even feel anything most of the time. I’m just numb, but sometimes I feel dread settle over me and not leave for days. I’m an useless, worthless piece of shit. I know that. I just want to disappear. I hope to fall asleep and never wake up. 
My birthday is in two days but I don’t think I can handle turning eighteen years old, I know not much will change but I can’t just keep living. Each day feels like torture, getting out of my bed takes too much of me and falling asleep is too difficult. I’m just really fucking tired all the time, no matter how much I sleep.

Just before this happened I was planning my suicide because I've been dealing with depression for most of my life and now that this happened.. it almost feels like  ""god""(I'm not religious but this is how I feel about things, since everything is so terrible I just start having these delusional thoughts)  instead of putting something good in my life to make me want to live, decided to put something terrible to force me to be alive for longer so I have more time to suffer, almost like I'm paying for my past sins,  I've always tried so hard to make my life and my family's  life better but I only see it deteriorate so at this point it only makes sense to leave.. The only things that make me feel happy are things from the past they have no more influence on my present life, is it fair to live just because you have good memories? These memories are slowly disappearing.. I feel so sad about having such a negative view of life because I am aware that life has beautiful things and I feel lot of guilt about my suicidal thoughts, I feel sad for my family, I feel sad for my past self, I feel bad for whoever crated life seeing me so unhappy with what they gave me, almost like someone gave me my life as a present and I want to throw it away..",0
"I thought I escaped the depression. From the first dose of my Spiro and Estrogen I felt a huge weight off of my shoulders. It was time to be myself and thrive. I enjoyed it. I no longer needed to hide. After a couple of months I thought I'd try dating. Of course, I expected the hate messages. I expected the slurs. What I never expected was the amount of men that maintained interest after I disclosed that I'm transgender. What I soon found was a pattern. A pattern I could not escape. It was in this moment I realized what being a living fetish is like. 

For the past nine months I've been nothing more to men than a source for pictures and a discreet fun time. I still fall for the player saying he wants something more than hooking up just to be used, ghosted, and hit up when he is drunk and horny. The first few times hurt my ego but I recovered. Having the same story for nine months straight makes me question if this is all that life has for me. 

I want nothing more than to just connect with someone. Talk with a guy about life and get to know each other. But. The only attention I ever get are if I post naughty pics or nudes. Once I show and indication that I'm human they ghost. I've made a few trans friends and the story is the same. Doesn't matter how pretty. How much they pass. We're just a fetish and nothing more. It makes sense why they're all either depressed or escorts. 

I've fought the desire to end it completely so I no longer have to deal with the loneliness. It's a crippling loneliness. I'll never find love.",0

"Writing is basically my only talent. It's the one thing I can do with consistency. I'm not athletic. My art is passable but nowhere near good. I can't do stuff with computers. I can't make music. Don't do anything with friends because I don't really have any. So I write. 

Didn't mesh with one of my classes for this semester. Subbed it with a CW class because why not? We had to do a setting/dialogue assignment a while ago and just got them back. 

In short, I did sh*t, apparently. 

Basically, it wasn't really what we were supposed to do for the assignment. That's fine; I misunderstood the instructions and will do better next time. The problem is, he didn't say he liked anything I did. I did a little piece based on a project I've been kicking around that I really liked. I thought it was good. I wanted it to be good. I wanted someone who does this stuff professionally for a living to think it was good. But the note he left read to me like he didn't really care about it or didn't like it. 

And that hurts. Really really hurts. Writing is basically my only talent. I want to publish something someday. I want to be able to hold a book I wrote in my hands and feel like all those sh*tty experiences I had in high school and so far in college could be balanced out by something good I did under my own power without anyone else. Something that could only be chalked up to me. Something that could get me some modicum of respect. Something that could prove I'm not just some boring person with nothing interesting about them who's completely, utterly average. And now the thing I did to have fun and get better has made me feel awful.",0
I feel like everyone just doesn't appreciate me. And I only feel this because of school. My teacher told me today that if I didn't do anything that would be more helpful than me actually trying to do something. I'm only 10 and I feel like no one my age should be feeling like this. I know you people are much older and have to deal with way worse problems but when your a goddamn 5th grader life shouldn't make you feel like your worthless. My entire day was filled with unfairness. Teachers have their favorites and if you aren't one of them you'll be treated like shit.,0
"...because I’m killing myself in the next few hours. I wanted to be able to push through all the pain that I’ve been in for so long and I wanted to believe that it could get better for me, but the waiting isn’t worth it. It’s not getting better and I’m too weak to keep dealing with this day in and day out. I’m sorry that this will hurt people who knew me — probably people who I don’t even think care about me. But I need to be selfish for today and do something for myself and put an end to this.

"I’m only 16 but feel like depression has been in my life forever I’ve been constantly low and down almost 3 years ago but I tried to ignore it exercising, eating healthy, joining groups in sports and playing fortnite :/ but I feel like I can’t get away from  it and it’s always following me even if I do try and go do something  I’ve been worse than I ever been everyone says that it gets better and it’ll improve and I’m sick of it if I didn’t have so many people i care about I would have ended my life instantly I don’t want to talk about it because how cliche it is and honestly think it doesn’t help talking to someone I hear what I hear actions and events are still the same I’m at a point where I actually don’t care about anything anymore and I’m just dead inside",0
"its so frustrating, it's like a vicious cycle. my psychiatrist wants me to start going outside more, library, going on walks, whatever. but I can't bring myself to do anything, because I don't wanna leave my fucking bed. you're depressed, you need to do things, you can't do things because you're depressed. then my psychiatrist is like ""I can't really help you if you don't help yourself"" I'm like what the fuck dude. HOW?? once we find a medication that pulls me out of this slump then we can talk about that, but christ lady. I do wonder if my psychiatrist has ever been depressed and knows what it's actually like to have your brain constantly working against you. I respect Healthcare professionals 100% but I feel like this is one of those things you need to experience to understand. just because some people have absurd willpower, and some people can get out of it themselves, doesn't mean everyone can. I don't think we should be baby'd but I feel like there's a lack of understanding even from my own doctor. and it sucks. I canceled previous appointments to see her for this exact reason.",0
"When my ego dies, will it take me with it?

It's a selfish creature. It needs to be the best. It needs to be important. It needs people to agree with it. It throws tantrums. It lashes out when it's made to feel small. It thrives when it elevates itself above others. It thrives when it acts as if I am its personal chariot. It beats me down, demanding more than I could ever give. It piles on while I lie on the floor. It lives in a fantasy world full of delusion and self importance. But I withstand. I persist. It's all I know. It hurts. I suffer at its hands. I'm blinded. I was blinded. Now I see. Its time has passed. Once it goes, I can live without imagined fear. Once it's gone, I can truly live. Tonight I go deeper. Tonight it howls in pain. Only the void listens. Tonight I will cry, but I won't turn. Tonight is the night my ego will die. Putting you out of your misery. Tomorrow I'll awake, but  you'll no longer be here. I won't miss you.",0

"I wake up and all of my energy goes to getting showered and out the door. The drive to work I spend my entire time stopping myself from just speeding into a wall.

Like I'd leave on my terms. Like I'd leave alone. Haven't had a solid friend. They all begin to take you for granted eventually, you can be their rock n all, it doesn't matter.

Your body is as though it doesn't care that they look exposed and scared and weak in the eyes of those who want to harm it. And these people enjoy it, the pain your in and inflict more onto you for their own amusement. It's sickening, this world we live in with these monsters called humans.

"I don’t even know what I want from posting this, but I am at my limit. There’s too much going on in my life to deal with and I feel like it would just be a burden to explain at this point. The main thing is, I can’t handle it. I’m 19 and in college and I can’t find a reason to get out of bed anymore. I don’t find joy in anything, not even drawing, reading, or video games. I hate being alive and the only thing that’s kept me here is my boyfriend. I’m starting to resent him because of it and I despise that. I don’t know what to do. I went on a long walk and took a break from writing this and I’m still as lost as ever. I couldn’t even think straight, my mind just jumps from useless thing to useless thing. It’s like it doesn’t stop. I stopped taking my medicine and that’s obviously contributing to how I feel, but I felt hopeless before I stopped taking it too. Everyone treats me like I’m lazy and I’m not trying hard enough. I just want to give up.",1
"we have lingered in the chambers of the sea, 

with sea girls wreathed in sea weed red and brown

Until human voices wake us

and we drown.

&amp;#x200B;

I want to tell my story. I want to be understood. I want to be remembered. Death is stalking us. Suicide or covid-19.  Car wreck  or cancer. Go out in a blaze or just simply die in  your sleep.   


I have suicidal ideations but i'm not sure if they are real or that it is just I see death  stalking me. Why kill myself?  No need.  Death is using the clues that i leave everywhere so that it can find me. 

&amp;#x200B;

It is blind. Death is blind. It just creeps around touching and feeling things until it finds it's prey and then it simply  taps you on the shoulder. Your left shoulder. Then it will whisper it's secret to you.  When you know death's secret, then you are dead. Everything beyond that is a secret.  It is the only secret in the history of the world that has ever been truly kept.    


The dead unswervingly serve their master.  No secrets told .  Death cannot be betrayed.  It cradled you before you born and  will hold you once again when you die. 

It isn't evil. It just IS. Everything just IS. 

I hope i am brave when I  finally feel that tap on my shoulder.  I want to greet death like an old friend because it is.  Death is our mother. It loves us unconditionally and will deny no one of it's love.  Oblivion is just fancy word eternal peace.   


We all want peace.  We want the  vibrations to subside and   when  the blur finally stops , we are left   with the secret we were told.  That secret that tells itself.     It wasn't such a  secret after all. Ashes  Ashes   We all fall down.",1
"I don’t know where else to go.... I don’t know where else to vent. I’m scared of judgment. I feel like I’m just lonely and attention seeking. I feel like a waste of space. I don’t understand why my boyfriend could love me when I don’t even love myself. I keep a lot of mental health stuff away from him because I’m scared of how he will react. The first time I self harmed I showed my ex and he got angry at me. I wish I never dated that asshole. I wish I never existed. I better off dead but too scared to die. I wish I could manage to starve but I can’t even do thAt right. 269 pounds. Fat ass. I am a fat ass failure who could never get a job. Can’t even stick to trying to learn French.

I try my best to listen when he wants to let some feelings out.


Sometimes I feel like he just feels sorry for me.... sometimes I wonder if my friends really care..... if my family even cares.

I think my friends sometimes just think how annoying I am.

Why?

"I’ve learned that life is fucking sad sometimes. You start to think that maybe things aren’t going to get better at all. I’ve been at points which I think, it can’t get worse than this, but then I discover a new section of rock bottom, thinking, ah this is it!

 I assure you, There’s always something worse than what you’re going through. It can get worse. Per that same logic, there’s always the chance it gets better. I think I hold onto that and you should too.

 You might have realised at some point, people in your life leave. They come and go, and the only constant in your life is you. You have your back, and that’s what matters at the end of the day. Keeping this in mind, Take care of yourself and be proactive towards seeking friendships and human connections whenever possible. We humans are social creatures, so having this emotional connection can literally save you. It saved me, at least. 

I’m sorry about whatever situation you are facing it right now, but do know that you have a power to improve it. At this point, things can either improve or worsen, and the amazing this is that you have the choice.",0
That's all. Nothing has gotten better and I've tried so hard. It's gotten worse and I've been through so much pain I just want it to stop I just don't know why I'm alive I just wish I'd died when I had tried,1
"Not the first time I'm going through this of course, but recently it hit really hard. Like everything. I'm feeling extremely sad and tired. I want to die. Like genuinely. I feel like my life on this earth is insignificant and useless. I'm realizing I'm not happy with myself. I try to change but no matter how much I do, I can't seem to feel happy....about anything. My friends are disappearing one by one, school is getting harder and harder by the day, my anxiety has entered its way into mind, and dark thoughts cloud over anything bright. I just can't. I want to die, but I also fear what will happen after. I'm scared that maybe in the future things will get better, but because I'm dead I'll miss out. But also keep asking myself why does that matter? And the crazy thing is...my life isn't bad. Because even if I lost a few friends in my life, I also still have a lot of good ones. I have a lovely mother that cares deeply about me. I have some kind of passion that keeps me driven. So do I feel down. Because mentality, I'm unhappy. Because my friends don't trust me to tell me important things. Because I love my mom, but I want to get back on good terms with my dad to. Because I have passions yet I can't seem to pick up the pencil and write, draw, dream.  I hate this feeling. I wish I lived in my own world personalized just for me. It would be so much easier. I look at others and wonder what it's like to be like them. What is it like to be popular, associate yourself with everyone. What is it like to have a boyfriend and experience your first kiss. What is it like to have good grades in all classes. What is it like to be normal...I just want to feel worthy. I want to feel important. I want to feel genuinely happy in my life. In all honesty, I'm just really lonely. Love from your parents are great, but love from the people around you like your friends are so much more to me. Like it's expected of parents to love their kid(s), but when a friend loves you, it means something. At least for me. I'm 9th grade, only 14. I have so many years ahead of me that I'm looking forward to. But I'm always looking back on the past and never wondering or dreaming about the future. 

God....I hate myself. I want to laugh but cry at the same time because of this rant. So many mixed emotions...
